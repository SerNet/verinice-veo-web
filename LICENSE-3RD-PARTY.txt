# CC0 1.0 Universal

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ‚Äúowner‚Äù) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a ‚ÄúWork‚Äù).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(‚ÄúCommons‚Äù) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the ‚ÄúAffirmer‚Äù), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (‚ÄúCopyright and
   Related Rights‚Äù). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person‚Äôs image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer‚Äôs Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the ‚ÄúWaiver‚Äù). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmer‚Äôs heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmer‚Äôs express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmer‚Äôs express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer‚Äôs Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the ‚ÄúLicense‚Äù). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmer‚Äôs express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person‚Äôs Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @gar/promisify@1.1.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @gar/promisify

### Promisify an entire object or class instance

This module leverages es6 Proxy and Reflect to promisify every function in an
object or class instance.

It assumes the callback that the function is expecting is the last
parameter, and that it is an error-first callback with only one value,
i.e. `(err, value) => ...`. This mirrors node's `util.promisify` method.

In order that you can use it as a one-stop-shop for all your promisify
needs, you can also pass it a function.  That function will be
promisified as normal using node's built-in `util.promisify` method.

[node's custom promisified
functions](https://nodejs.org/api/util.html#util_custom_promisified_functions)
will also be mirrored, further allowing this to be a drop-in replacement
for the built-in `util.promisify`.

### Examples

Promisify an entire object

```javascript

const promisify = require('@gar/promisify')

class Foo {
  constructor (attr) {
    this.attr = attr
  }

  double (input, cb) {
    cb(null, input * 2)
  }

const foo = new Foo('baz')
const promisified = promisify(foo)

console.log(promisified.attr)
console.log(await promisified.double(1024))
```

Promisify a function

```javascript

const promisify = require('@gar/promisify')

function foo (a, cb) {
  if (a !== 'bad') {
    return cb(null, 'ok')
  }
  return cb('not ok')
}

const promisified = promisify(foo)

// This will resolve to 'ok'
promisified('good')

// this will reject
promisified('bad')
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @nuxt/babel-preset-app@2.15.8

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `@nuxt/babel-preset-app`

> Default babel preset for nuxt

## Usage

This is the default preset used by Nuxt, which is mainly a wrapper around the `@babel/preset-env` preset. It also optionally uses the `@vue/babel-preset-jsx` preset as well as `@babel/plugin-proposal-decorators`, `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`, `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`. Furthermore the preset is adding polyfills.

**Note**: Since `core-js@2` and `core-js@3` are both supported from Babel 7.4.0, we recommend directly adding `core-js` and setting the version via the [`corejs`](#corejs) option.

```sh
yarn add --dev core-js@3 @babel/runtime-corejs3

# or

yarn add --dev core-js@2 @babel/runtime-corejs2

```

Usually, no additional configuration is required. If needed though, there is an option to fine-tune the preset's behavior. Just add the following to `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
babel: {
  presets(env, [ preset, options ]) {
    return [
      [ "@nuxt/babel-preset-app", options ]
    ]
  }
}
```

`env` is an object which contains `envName` (`server`, `client`, `modern`) and all `nuxtEnv` properties (`isDev`, `isServer`, `isClient`, `isModern`, `isLegacy`)

`preset` is the preset package name `@nuxt/babel-preset-app`

`options` is an object with parameters, for example:

```js
const options = {
  useBuiltIns: "entry"
}
```

Below is a list of all available `options` parameters:

### Options

* **bugfixes** - [`@babel/preset-env`](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#bugfixes)
* **configPath** - [`@babel/preset-env` parameter](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#configpath)
* **forceAllTransforms** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#forcealltransforms)' parameter
* **debug**, default  `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#debug)' parameter
* **decoratorsBeforeExport**
* **decoratorsLegacy**, default true
* **exclude** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#exclude)' parameter

* **jsx**, default true, can be a an object passed as params to [@vue/babel-preset-jsx`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vue/babel-preset-jsx)
* **loose**, default `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#loose)' parameter and also sets `loose=true` for `@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties`
* **modules**, default `false` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#modules)' parameter
* **polyfills**, default `core-js@2: ['es6.array.iterator','es6.promise','es6.object.assign','es7.promise.finally']`, `core-js@3: ['es.array.iterator','es.promise','es.object.assign','es.promise.finally']`, more [in the corresponding repository](https://github.com/zloirock/core-js)
* **shippedProposals** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#shippedproposals)' parameter
* **spec** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#spec)' parameter
* **targets** - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#targets)' parameter
* **useBuiltIns**, default `"usage"` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#usebuiltins)' parameter
* **corejs**, default `{ version: 2 }` - '[@babel/preset-env](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#corejs)' parameter

There are [detailed docs](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-preset-env#options) for the parameters of '@babel/preset-env'.

### Example 1. Change targets for server and client respectively

```js
export default {
  build: {
    babel: {
      presets({ envName }) {
        const envTargets = {
          client: { browsers: ["last 2 versions"], ie: 11 },
          server: { node: "current" },
        }
        return [
          [
            "@nuxt/babel-preset-app",
            {
              targets: envTargets[envName]
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 2. Use core-js@3

**NOTE**: Make sure that all dependencies have been upgraded to use core-js@3. If core-js@2 and core-js@3 are both dependent, babel may resolve incorrect core-js package which is hoisted by yarn/npm.

```sh
yarn add --dev core-js@3 @babel/runtime-corejs3
```

```js
export default {
  build: {
    babel: {
      // envName: server, client, modern
      presets({ envName }) {
        return [
          [
            '@nuxt/babel-preset-app',
            {
              corejs: { version: 3 }
            }
          ]
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Youch is inspired by [Whoops](https://filp.github.io/whoops) but with a modern design. Reading stack trace of the console slows you down from active development. Instead **Youch** print those errors in structured HTML to the browser.

## Features
1. HTML reporter
2. JSON reporter, if request accepts a json instead of text/html.
3. Sorted frames of error stack.

## Installation
```bash
npm i --save @nuxtjs/youch
```

## Basic Usage
Youch is used by [AdonisJs](http://adonisjs.com) and [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org), but it can be used by express or raw HTTP server as well.

```javascript
const Youch = require('@nuxtjs/youch')
const http = require('http')

http.createServer(function (req, res) {

  // PERFORM SOME ACTION
  if (error) {
    const youch = new Youch(error, req)

    youch
    .toHTML()
    .then((html) => {
      res.writeHead(200, {'content-type': 'text/html'})
      res.write(html)
      res.end()
    })
  }

}).listen(8000)
```

      - toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.min.css
```

## üì¶ Usage npm

To use the plugin, [`@toast-ui/editor`](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/tree/master/apps/editor) must be installed.

> Ref. [Getting Started](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/blob/master/docs/en/getting-started.md)

### Install

```sh
$ npm install @toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight
```

### Import Plugin

Along with the plugin, the plugin's dependency style must be imported. 
The `code-syntax-highlight` plugin has [`Prism.js`](https://prismjs.com/) as a dependency, and you need to add a CSS file of `Prism.js`.

#### ES Modules

```js
import 'prismjs/themes/prism.css';
import '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/dist/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.css';

import codeSyntaxHighlight from '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight';
```

#### CommonJS

```js
require('prismjs/themes/prism.css');
require('@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/dist/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.css');

const codeSyntaxHighlight = require('@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight');
```

### Create Instance

When you set up a plugin function, you must set it with an option. The option has `highlighter`, and you need to import [`Prism.js`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/prismjs) before creating an instance and set it to the value of that option.

The main bundle file of `Prism.js` contains just several language pack it supports. So we provides the bundle file(`toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight-all.js`) to import all languages you need in `Prism.js`.

#### Basic

##### Import All Languages

```js
// ...
import Editor from '@toast-ui/editor';
import codeSyntaxHighlight from '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/dist/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight-all.js';


const editor = new Editor({
  // ...
  plugins: [[codeSyntaxHighlight, { highlighter: Prism }]]
});
```

##### Import Only Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãYou Need

You need to import the language files you want to use in the code block and register them in the `Prism.js` object. A list of available language files can be found [here](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/tree/master/components).

```js
// ...
import 'prismjs/themes/prism.css';
import '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/dist/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.css';

// Step 1. Import Prism.js
import Prism from 'prismjs';

// Step 2. Import language files of Prism.js that you need
import 'prismjs/components/prism-clojure.js';

import Editor from '@toast-ui/editor';
import codeSyntaxHighlight from '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight';

const editor = new Editor({
  // ...
  plugins: [[codeSyntaxHighlight, { highlighter: Prism }]]
});
```

#### With Viewer

As with creating an editor instance, you need to import `Prism.js` and pass it to the `highlighter` option.

```js
// ...
import 'prismjs/themes/prism.css';
import '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/dist/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.css';

import Viewer from '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor-viewer';
import codeSyntaxHighlight from '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight';

// Import Prism.js
// ...

const viewer = new Viewer({
  // ...
  plugins: [[codeSyntaxHighlight, { highlighter: Prism }]]
});
```

or

```js
// ...
import 'prismjs/themes/prism.css';
import '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/dist/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.css';

import Editor from '@toast-ui/editor';
import codeSyntaxHighlight from '@toast-ui/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight';

// Import Prism.js
// ...

const viewer = Editor.factory({
  // ...
  viewer: true,
  plugins: [[codeSyntaxHighlight, { highlighter: Prism }]]
});
```

## üóÇ Usage CDN

### Include Files

To use the plugin, the CDN files(CSS, Script) of `@toast-ui/editor` must be included.

### Create Instance

#### Basic

First, include the editor file. And include the plugin file as needed. If you want to include all language files provided by `Prism.js`, see the first title(_Include All Languages_). If you want to register and use only the languages ‚Äã‚Äãyou need, see the second title(_Include Only Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãYou Need_).

##### Include All Languages

By including the **all** version of the plugin, all languages ‚Äã‚Äãof `Prism.js` are available in the code block.

```html
...
<head>
  ...
  <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/themes/prism.min.css"
  />
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/latest/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.min.css"
  />
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <!-- Editor -->
  <script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor/latest/toastui-editor-all.min.js"></script>
  <!-- Editor's Plugin -->
  <script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/latest/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight-all.min.js"></script>
  ...
</body>
...
```

```js
const { Editor } = toastui;
const { codeSyntaxHighlight } = Editor.plugin;

const instance = new Editor({
  // ...
  plugins: [codeSyntaxHighlight]
});
```

##### Include Only Languages ‚Äã‚ÄãYou Need

If you include the **normal** version of the plugin, only the languages ‚Äã‚Äãyou need are available. At this time, you should also include the language files of `Prism.js`, and if you only include it, the languages ‚Äã‚Äãavailable to the plugin are registered.

> Note : The CDN provided by `Prism.js` contains several language files. If you want to add other language files, you can use [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/prism) to add each language file or upload a file containing only the language you need on [this page](https://prismjs.com/download.html).

```html
...
<head>
  ...
  <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/themes/prism.min.css"
  />
  <link
    rel="stylesheet"
    href="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/latest/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.min.css"
  />
  ...
</head>
  ...
</head>
<body>
  ...
  <!-- Editor -->
  <script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor/latest/toastui-editor-all.min.js"></script>
  <!-- Prism.js Languages -->
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/prism.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/prism/1.23.0/components/prism-clojure.min.js"></script>
  <!-- Editor's Plugin -->
  <script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight/latest/toastui-editor-plugin-code-syntax-highlight.min.js"></script>
  ...
</body>
...
```

#### With Viewer

The way to include the plugin and the language files of `Prism.js` is the same as above.

##### Use Option of Editor

```js
const { Editor } = tosatui;
const { codeSyntaxHighlight } = Editor.plugin;

const editor = Editor.factory({
  // ...
  plugins: [codeSyntaxHighlight],
  viewer: true
});
```

##### Use Viewer

Include the Viewer file instead of the Editor.

```html
...
<body>
  ...
  <script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor/latest/toastui-editor-viewer.min.js"></script>
  ...
</body>
...
```

```js
const Viewer = toastui.Editor;
const { codeSyntaxHighlight } = Viewer.plugin;

const viewer = new Viewer({
  // ...
  plugins: [codeSyntaxHighlight]
});
```

## Collect Statistics on the Use of Open Source

TOAST UI products apply Google Analytics (GA) to collect statistics on the use of open source, in order to identify how widely TOAST UI Editor is used throughout the world. It also serves as important index to determine the future course of projects. `location.hostname` (e.g. ui.toast.com) is to be collected and the sole purpose is nothing but to measure statistics on the usage.

To disable GA, use the following `usageStatistics` option when creating the instance.

```js
const options = {
  // ...
  usageStatistics: false
};

const editor = new Editor(options);
```

You can also see the older versions of API page on the [releases page](https://github.com/nhn/tui.editor/releases).

## üíæ Install

TOAST UI products can be used by using the package manager or downloading the source directly. However, we highly recommend using the package manager.

### Via Package Manager

TOAST UI products are registered in two package managers, [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/). You can conveniently install it using the commands provided by the package manager. When using npm, be sure to use it in the environment [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is installed.

#### npm

```sh
$ npm install --save @toast-ui/editor # Latest Version
$ npm install --save @toast-ui/editor@<version> # Specific Version
```

### Via Contents Delivery Network (CDN)

TOAST UI products are available over the CDN powered by [TOAST Cloud](https://www.toast.com).

You can use the CDN as below.

```html
...
<body>
  ...
  <script src="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor/latest/toastui-editor-all.min.js"></script>
</body>
...
```

If you want to use a specific version, use the tag name instead of `latest` in the url's path.

The CDN directory has the following structure:

```
- uicdn.toast.com/
   ‚îú‚îÄ editor/
   ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ latest/
   ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ toastui-editor-all.js
   ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ toastui-editor-all.min.js
   ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îú‚îÄ toastui-editor-viewer.js

   ‚îÇ     ‚îú‚îÄ 2.0.0/
   ‚îÇ     ‚îÇ    ‚îî‚îÄ ...
```

## üî® Usage

First, you need to add the container element where TOAST UI Editor (henceforth referred to as 'Editor') will be created.

```html
...
<body>
  <div id="editor"></div>
</body>
...
```

The editor can be used by creating an instance with the constructor function. To get the constructor function, you should import the module using one of the following ways depending on your environment.

### Using Module Format in Node Environment

- ES6 Modules

```javascript
import Editor from '@toast-ui/editor';
```

- CommonJS

```javascript
const Editor = require('@toast-ui/editor');
```

### Using Namespace in Browser Environment

```javascript
const Editor = toastui.Editor;
```

Then, you need to add the CSS files needed for the Editor. Import CSS files in node environment, and add it to html file when using CDN.

### Using in Node Environment

```javascript
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css'; // Editor's Style
```

### Using in Browser Environment by CDN

```html
...
<head>
  ...
  <!-- Editor's Style -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://uicdn.toast.com/editor/latest/toastui-editor.min.css" />
</head>
...
```

Finally you can create an instance with options and call various API after creating an instance.

```javascript
const editor = new Editor({
  el: document.querySelector('#editor'),
  height: '500px',
  initialEditType: 'markdown',
  previewStyle: 'vertical'
});

editor.getMarkdown();
```

### Default Options

- `height`: Height in string or auto ex) `300px` | `auto`
- `initialEditType`: Initial type to show `markdown` | `wysiwyg`
- `initialValue`: Initial value. Set Markdown string
- `previewStyle`: Preview style of Markdown mode `tab` | `vertical`
- `usageStatistics`: Let us know the _hostname_. We want to learn from you how you are using the Editor. You are free to disable it. `true` | `false`

Find out more options [here](https://nhn.github.io/tui.editor/latest/ToastUIEditor).

## Collect Statistics on the Use of Open Source

Vue Wrapper of TOAST UI Editor applies Google Analytics (GA) to collect statistics on the use of open source, in order to identify how widely TOAST UI Editor is used throughout the world. It also serves as important index to determine the future course of projects. location.hostname (e.g. ui.toast.com) is to be collected and the sole purpose is nothing but to measure statistics on the usage. To disable GA, use the following `usageStatistics` options when declare Vue Wrapper component.

```js
const options = {
  ...
  usageStatistics: false
}
```

## üíæ Install

### Using npm

```sh
npm install --save @toast-ui/vue-editor
```

## üìù Editor Usage

### Import

You can use Toast UI Editor for Vue as a ECMAScript module or a CommonJS module. As this module does not contain CSS files, you should import `toastui-editor.css` from `@toast-ui/editor` in the script.

- ES Modules

```js
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css';

import { Editor } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';
```

- CommonJS

```js
require('@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css');

const { Editor } = require('@toast-ui/vue-editor');
```

### Creating Component

First implement `<editor/>` in the template.

```html
<template>
  <editor />
</template>
```

And then add `Editor` to the `components` in your component or Vue instance like this:

```js
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css';

import { Editor } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

export default {
  components: {
    editor: Editor
  }
};
```

or

```js
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css';

import { Editor } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  components: {
    editor: Editor
  }
});
```

### Props

| Name            | Type   | Default                    | Description                                               |
| --------------- | ------ | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| initialValue    | String | ''                         | Editor's initial value       .                             |
| initialEditType | String | 'markdown'                 | Initial editor type (markdown, wysiwyg).                   |
| options         | Object | following `defaultOptions` | Options of tui.editor. This is for initailize tui.editor. |
| height          | String | '300px'                    | This prop can control the height of the editor.           |
| previewStyle          | String | 'vertical'           | Markdown editor's preview style (tab, vertical).           |

```js
const defaultOptions = {
  minHeight: '200px',
  language: 'en-US',
  useCommandShortcut: true,
  usageStatistics: true,
  hideModeSwitch: false,
  toolbarItems: [
    ['heading', 'bold', 'italic', 'strike'],
    ['hr', 'quote'],
    ['ul', 'ol', 'task', 'indent', 'outdent'],
    ['table', 'image', 'link'],
    ['code', 'codeblock'],
    ['scrollSync'],
  ]
};
```

```html
<template>
  <editor
    :initialValue="editorText"
    :options="editorOptions"
    height="500px"
    initialEditType="wysiwyg"
    previewStyle="vertical"
  />
</template>
<script>
  import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css';

  import { Editor } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

  export default {
    components: {
      editor: Editor
    },
    data() {
      return {
        editorText: 'This is initialValue.',
        editorOptions: {
          hideModeSwitch: true
        }
      };
    }
  };
</script>
```

### Instance Methods

If you want to more manipulate the Editor, you can use `invoke` method to call the method of toastui.editor. For more information of method, see [instance methods of TOAST UI Editor](https://nhn.github.io/tui.editor/latest/ToastUIEditor#addHook).

First, you need to assign `ref` attribute of `<editor/>` and then you can use `invoke` method through `this.$refs` like this:

```html
<template>
  <editor ref="toastuiEditor" />
</template>
<script>
  import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor.css';

  import { Editor } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

  export default {
    components: {
      editor: Editor
    },
    methods: {
      scroll() {
        this.$refs.toastuiEditor.invoke('setScrollTop', 10);
      },
      moveTop() {
        this.$refs.toastuiEditor.invoke('moveCursorToStart');
      },
      getHTML() {
        let html = this.$refs.toastuiEditor.invoke('getHTML');
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```

### Events

- load : It would be emitted when editor fully load
- change : It would be emitted when content changed
- caretChange : It would be emitted when format change by cursor position
- focus : It would be emitted when editor get focus
- blur : It would be emitted when editor loose focus

```html
<template>
  <editor
    @load="onEditorLoad"
    @focus="onEditorFocus"
    @blur="onEditorBlur"
    @change="onEditorChange"
    @caretChange="onEditorCaretChange"
  />
</template>
<script>
  import { Editor } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

  export default {
    components: {
      editor: Editor
    },
    methods: {
      onEditorLoad() {
        // implement your code
      },
      onEditorFocus() {
        // implement your code
      },
      onEditorBlur() {
        // implement your code
      },
      onEditorChange() {
        // implement your code
      },
      onEditorCaretChange() {
        // implement your code
      }
    }
  };
</script>
```

## üìÉ Viewer Usage

### Import

- ES Modules

```js
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor-viewer.css';

import { Viewer } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';
```

- CommonJS

```js
require('@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor-viewer.css');

const { Viewer } = require('@toast-ui/vue-editor');
```

### Creating Component

First implement `<viewer />` in the template.

```html
<template>
  <viewer />
</template>
```

And then add `Viewer` to the `components` in your component or Vue instance like this:

```js
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor-viewer.css';

import { Viewer } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

export default {
  components: {
    viewer: Viewer
  }
};
```

or

```js
import '@toast-ui/editor/dist/toastui-editor-viewer.css';

import { Viewer } from '@toast-ui/vue-editor';

new Vue({
  el: '#app',
  components: {
    viewer: Viewer
  }
});
```

### Props

| Name         | Type   | Default | Description                                     |

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx@1.2.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx

> Babel plugin for Vue 2.0 JSX

### Babel Compatibility Notes

- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)

### Requirements

- Assumes you are using Babel with a module bundler e.g. Webpack, because the spread merge helper is imported as a module to avoid duplication.

- This is mutually exclusive with `babel-plugin-transform-react-jsx`.

### Usage

```bash
npm install @vue/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx --save-dev
npm install @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props --save
```

In your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["transform-vue-jsx"]
}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

The plugin transpiles the following JSX:

```jsx
<div id="foo">{this.text}</div>
```

To the following JavaScript:

```js
h(
  'div',
  {
    attrs: {
      id: 'foo',
    },
  },
  [this.text],
)
```

Note the `h` function, which is a shorthand for a Vue instance's `$createElement` method, must be in the scope where the JSX is. Since this method is passed to component render functions as the first argument, in most cases you'd do this:

```js
Vue.component('jsx-example', {
  render(h) {
    // <-- h must be in scope
    return <div id="foo">bar</div>
  },
})
```

### Difference from React JSX

First, Vue 2.0's vnode format is different from React's. The second argument to the `createElement` call is a "data object" that accepts nested objects. Each nested object will be then processed by corresponding modules:

```js
render (h) {
  return h('div', {
    // Component props
    props: {
      msg: 'hi'
    },
    // Normal HTML attributes
    attrs: {
      id: 'foo'
    },
    // DOM props
    domProps: {
      innerHTML: 'bar'
    },
    // Event handlers are nested under "on", though
    // modifiers such as in v-on:keyup.enter are not
    // supported. You'll have to manually check the
    // keyCode in the handler instead.
    on: {
      click: this.clickHandler
    },
    // For components only. Allows you to listen to
    // native events, rather than events emitted from
    // the component using vm.$emit.
    nativeOn: {
      click: this.nativeClickHandler
    },
    // Class is a special module, same API as `v-bind:class`
    class: {
      foo: true,
      bar: false
    },
    // Style is also same as `v-bind:style`
    style: {
      color: 'red',
      fontSize: '14px'
    },
    // Other special top-level properties
    key: 'key',
    ref: 'ref',
    // Assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for
    refInFor: true,
    slot: 'slot'
  })
}
```

The equivalent of the above in Vue 2.0 JSX is:

```jsx
render (h) {
  return (
    <div
      // Component props
      propsMsg="hi"
      // Normal attributes or component props.
      id="foo"
      // DOM properties are prefixed with `domProps`
      domPropsInnerHTML="bar"
      // event listeners are prefixed with `on` or `nativeOn`
      onClick={this.clickHandler}
      nativeOnClick={this.nativeClickHandler}
      // other special top-level properties
      class={{ foo: true, bar: false }}
      style={{ color: 'red', fontSize: '14px' }}
      key="key"
      ref="ref"
      // assign the `ref` is used on elements/components with v-for
      refInFor
      slot="slot">
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Component Tip

If a custom element starts with lowercase, it will be treated as a string id and used to lookup a registered component. If it starts with uppercase, it will be treated as an identifier, which allows you to do:

```js
import Todo from './Todo.js'

export default {
  render(h) {
    return <Todo /> // no need to register Todo via components option
  },
}
```

### JSX Spread

JSX spread is supported, and this plugin will intelligently merge nested data properties. For example:

```jsx
const data = {
  class: ['b', 'c'],
}
const vnode = <div class="a" {...data} />
```

The merged data will be:

```js
{ class: ['a', 'b', 'c'] }
```

### Vue directives

Vue directives are usable the same way as in template with a few key differences:

1.  You can use directives camelCased instead of kebab-cased (vMyDirective is treated as `v-my-directive`)
2.  You have to use underscore sign instead of dots for modifiers because of JSXIdentifier limitation.
3.  Only runtime directives work (only v-show and custom directives), compile-time directives are out of this project's scope.

A full example would be: `<MyComponent vMyDirective:argument_modifier1_modifier2={someExpression} />`

npm install @vue/babel-preset-jsx @vue/babel-helper-vue-jsx-merge-props --save
```

In your `babel.config.js`:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: ['@vue/babel-preset-jsx'],
}
```

You can toggle specific features, by default all features (except `compositionAPI`) are enabled, e.g.:

```js
module.exports = {
  presets: [
    [
      '@vue/babel-preset-jsx',
      {
        vModel: false,
        compositionAPI: true,
      },
    ],
  ],
}
```

Options are:

- `compositionAPI` - Enables [@vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-inject-h](../babel-sugar-composition-api-inject-h) and [@vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance](../babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance), support returning render function in `setup`.
- `functional` [@vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue](../babel-sugar-functional-vue/README.md) - Functional components syntactic sugar
- `injectH` [@vue/babel-sugar-inject-h](../babel-sugar-inject-h/README.md) - Automatic `h` injection syntactic sugar
- `vModel` [@vue/babel-sugar-v-model](../babel-sugar-v-model/README.md) - `vModel` syntactic sugar
- `vOn` [@vue/babel-sugar-v-on](../babel-sugar-v-on/README.md) - `vOn` syntactic sugar

> Ported from [luwanquan/babel-preset-vca-jsx](https://github.com/luwanquan/babel-preset-vca-jsx) by [@luwanquan](https://github.com/luwanquan)

Syntactic sugar for automatic `h` inject in JSX with @vue/composition-api.

### Babel Compatibility Notes

- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x

### Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
# for yarn:
yarn add @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-inject-h
# for npm:
npm install @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-inject-h --save
```

In your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-inject-h"]
}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

This plugin automatically injects `h` in every method that has JSX. By using this plugin you don't have to always import `h` from `@vue/composition-api`.

```js
// Without @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h
import { h } from '@vue/composition-api'

export default {
  setup() {
    return () => <button />
  },
}
```

```js
// With @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h
export default {
  setup() {
    return () => <button />
  },
}
```

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance@1.2.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance

> Ported from [luwanquan/babel-preset-vca-jsx](https://github.com/luwanquan/babel-preset-vca-jsx) by [@luwanquan](https://github.com/luwanquan)

Babel syntactic sugar for replacing `this` with `getCurrentInstance()` in Vue JSX with @vue/composition-api

### Babel Compatibility Notes

- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x

### Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
# for yarn:
yarn add @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance
# for npm:
npm install @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance --save
```

In your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance"]
}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

This plugin automatically replaces `this` in `setup()` with `getCurrentInstance()`. This is required for JSX to work in @vue/composition-api as `this` is not available in `setup()`

Input:

```jsx
defineComponent({ 
  setup() {
    return () => <MyComponent vModel={a.b} />
  }
})
```

Output (without @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance):

```jsx
defineComponent({
  setup() {
    return () => <MyComponent model={{
      value: a.b,
      callback: $$v => {
        this.$set(a, "b", $$v);
      }
    }} />
  }
})
```

Output (with @vue/babel-sugar-composition-api-render-instance):

```jsx
import { getCurrentInstance } from "@vue/composition-api";

defineComponent({
  setup() {
    const __currentInstance = getCurrentInstance();

    return () => <MyComponent model={{
      value: a.b,
      callback: $$v => {
        __currentInstance.$set(a, "b", $$v);
      }
    }} />
  }
})
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue@1.2.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue

Syntactic sugar for functional components.

### Babel Compatibility Notes

- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)

### Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
# for yarn:
yarn add @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue
# for npm:
npm install @vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue --save
```

In your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@vue/babel-sugar-functional-vue"]
}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

This plugin transpiles arrow functions that return JSX into functional components but only if it's an uppercase variable declaration or default export:

```js
// Original:
export const A = ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>
export const b = ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>
export default ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>

// Result:
export const A = {
  functional: true,
  render: (h, {
    props,
    listeners
  }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>
}
export const b = ({ props, listeners }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>
export default {
  functional: true,
  render: (h, {
    props,
    listeners
  }) => <div onClick={listeners.click}>{props.msg}</div>
}
```

}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

This plugin automatically injects `h` in every method that has JSX. By using this plugin you don't have to always specifically declare `h` as first parameter in your `render()` function.

```js
// Without @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h
export default {
  render (h) {
    return <button />
  }
}

// With @vue/babel-sugar-inject-h

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @vue/babel-sugar-v-model@1.2.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## @vue/babel-sugar-v-model

Syntactic sugar for v-model in JSX.

### Babel Compatibility Notes

- This repo is only compatible with Babel 7.x, for 6.x please use [vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx](https://github.com/vuejs/babel-plugin-transform-vue-jsx)

### Usage

Install the dependencies:

```sh
# for yarn:
yarn add @vue/babel-sugar-v-model
# for npm:
npm install @vue/babel-sugar-v-model --save
```

In your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "plugins": ["@vue/babel-sugar-v-model"]
}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

This plugin adds v-model to the JSX and tries to mirror the same behaviour as in vue-template-compiler, with a few differences:

1.  You should use underscore (`_`) instead of dot (`.`) for modifiers (`vModel_trim={this.test}`)
2.  It is recommended to use camelCase version of it (`vModel`) in JSX, but you can use kebab-case too (`v-model`).

```js
export default {
  data: () => ({
    test: 'Hello World',
  }),
  render(h) {
    return (
      <div>
        <input type="text" vModel_trim={this.test} />
        {this.test}
      </div>
    )
  },
}

{
  "plugins": ["@vue/babel-sugar-v-on"]
}
```

However it is recommended to use the [configurable preset](../babel-preset-jsx/README.md) instead.

### Details

This plugin adds v-on to the JSX and tries to mirror the same behaviour as in vue-template-compiler, with a few differences:

1.  You should use underscore (`_`) instead of dot (`.`) for modifiers (`vOn:click_prevent={this.test}`)
2.  It is recommended to use camelCase version of it (`vOn`) in JSX, but you can use kebab-case too (`v-on`).

```js
export default {
  methods: {
    test() {
      console.log('Hello World')
    },
  },
  render(h) {

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @vue/component-compiler-utils@3.2.2

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @vue/component-compiler-utils [![Build Status](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/vuejs/component-compiler-utils/)

> Lower level utilities for compiling Vue single file components

This package contains lower level utilities that you can use if you are writing a plugin / transform for a bundler or module system that compiles Vue single file components into JavaScript. It is used in [vue-loader](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader) version 15 and above.

The API surface is intentionally minimal - the goal is to reuse as much as possible while being as flexible as possible.

## Why isn't `vue-template-compiler` a peerDependency?

Since this package is more often used as a low-level utility, it is usually a transitive dependency in an actual Vue project. It is therefore the responsibility of the higher-level package (e.g. `vue-loader`) to inject `vue-template-compiler` via options when calling the `parse` and `compileTemplate` methods.

Not listing it as a peer depedency also allows tooling authors to use a non-default template compiler instead of `vue-template-compiler` without having to include it just to fullfil the peer dep requirement.

## API

### parse(ParseOptions): SFCDescriptor

Parse raw single file component source into a descriptor with source maps. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.

``` ts
interface ParseOptions {
  source: string
  filename?: string
  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler
  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilerparsecomponentfile-options
  // default: { pad: 'line' }
  compilerParseOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerParseOptions
  sourceRoot?: string
  needMap?: boolean
}

interface SFCDescriptor {
  template: SFCBlock | null
  script: SFCBlock | null
  styles: SFCBlock[]
  customBlocks: SFCCustomBlock[]
}

interface SFCCustomBlock {
  type: string
  content: string
  attrs: { [key: string]: string | true }
  start: number
  end: number
  map?: RawSourceMap
}

interface SFCBlock extends SFCCustomBlock {
  lang?: string
  src?: string
  scoped?: boolean
  module?: string | boolean
}
```

### compileTemplate(TemplateCompileOptions): TemplateCompileResults

Takes raw template source and compile it into JavaScript code. The actual compiler (`vue-template-compiler`) must be passed in via the `compiler` option so that the specific version used can be determined by the end user.

It can also optionally perform pre-processing for any templating engine supported by [consolidate](https://github.com/tj/consolidate.js/).

``` ts
interface TemplateCompileOptions {
  source: string
  filename: string

  compiler: VueTemplateCompiler
  // https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/packages/vue-template-compiler#compilercompiletemplate-options
  // default: {}
  compilerOptions?: VueTemplateCompilerOptions

  // Template preprocessor
  preprocessLang?: string
  preprocessOptions?: any

  // Transform asset urls found in the template into `require()` calls
  // This is off by default. If set to true, the default value is
  // {
  //   audio: 'src',
  //   video: ['src', 'poster'],
  //   source: 'src',
  //   img: 'src',
  //   image: ['xlink:href', 'href'],
  //   use: ['xlink:href', 'href']
  // }
  transformAssetUrls?: AssetURLOptions | boolean

  // For vue-template-es2015-compiler, which is a fork of Buble
  transpileOptions?: any

  isProduction?: boolean  // default: false
  isFunctional?: boolean  // default: false
  optimizeSSR?: boolean   // default: false

  // Whether prettify compiled render function or not (development only)
  // default: true
  prettify?: boolean
}

interface TemplateCompileResult {
  ast: Object | undefined
  code: string
  source: string
  tips: string[]
  errors: string[]
}

interface AssetURLOptions {
  [name: string]: string | string[]
}
```

#### Handling the Output

The resulting JavaScript code will look like this:

``` js
var render = function (h) { /* ... */}
var staticRenderFns = [function (h) { /* ... */}, function (h) { /* ... */}]
```

It **does NOT** assume any module system. It is your responsibility to handle the exports, if needed.

### compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)

Take input raw CSS and applies scoped CSS transform. It does NOT handle pre-processors. If the component doesn't use scoped CSS then this step can be skipped.

``` ts
interface StyleCompileOptions {
  source: string
  filename: string
  id: string
  map?: any
  scoped?: boolean
  trim?: boolean
  preprocessLang?: string
  preprocessOptions?: any
  postcssOptions?: any
  postcssPlugins?: any[]
}

interface StyleCompileResults {
  code: string
  map: any | void
  rawResult: LazyResult | void // raw lazy result from PostCSS
  errors: string[]
}
```

### compileStyleAsync(StyleCompileOptions)

Same as `compileStyle(StyleCompileOptions)` but it returns a Promise resolving to `StyleCompileResults`. It can be used with async postcss plugins.

-----------

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - @vue/ref-transform@3.2.19

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# @vue/ref-transform

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This is experimental and currently only provided for testing and feedback. It may break during patches or even be removed. Use at your own risk!
>
> Follow https://github.com/vuejs/rfcs/discussions/369 for details and updates.

## Basic Rules

- `$()` to turn refs into reative variables
- `$$()` to access the original refs from reative variables

```js
import { ref, watch } from 'vue'

// bind ref as a variable
let count = $(ref(0))

// no need for .value
console.log(count)

// get the actual ref
watch($$(count), c => console.log(`count changed to ${c}`))

// assignments are reactive
count++
```

### Shorthands

A few commonly used APIs have shorthands (which also removes the need to import them):

- `$(ref(0))` -> `$ref(0)`
- `$(computed(() => 123))` -> `$computed(() => 123)`
- `$(shallowRef({}))` -> `$shallowRef({})`

## API

This package is the lower-level transform that can be used standalone. Higher-level tooling (e.g. `@vitejs/plugin-vue` and `vue-loader`) will provide integration via options.

### `shouldTransform`

Can be used to do a cheap check to determine whether full transform should be performed.

```js
import { shouldTransform } from '@vue/ref-transform'

shouldTransform(`let a = ref(0)`) // false
shouldTransform(`let a = $ref(0)`) // true
```

### `transform`

```js
import { transform } from '@vue/ref-transform'

const src = `let a = $ref(0); a++`
const {
  code, // import { ref as _ref } from 'vue'; let a = (ref(0)); a.value++"
  map
} = transform(src, {
  filename: 'foo.ts',
  sourceMap: true,

  // @babel/parser plugins to enable.
  // 'typescript' and 'jsx' will be auto-inferred from filename if provided,
  // so in most cases explicit parserPlugins are not necessary
  parserPlugins: [/* ... */]
})
```

**Options**

```ts
interface RefTransformOptions {
  filename?: string
  sourceMap?: boolean // default: false
  parserPlugins?: ParserPlugin[]
  importHelpersFrom?: string // default: "vue"
}
```

### `transformAST`

Transform with an existing Babel AST + MagicString instance. This is used internally by `@vue/compiler-sfc` to avoid double parse/transform cost.

```js
import { transformAST } from '@vue/ref-transform'
import { parse } from '@babel/parser'
import MagicString from 'magic-string'

const src = `let a = $ref(0); a++`
const ast = parse(src, { sourceType: 'module' })
const s = new MagicString(src)

const {
  rootVars, // ['a']
  importedHelpers // ['ref']
} = transformAST(ast, s)

console.log(s.toString()) // let a = _ref(0); a.value++
```

   "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
   the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
   to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
   submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
   or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
   the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
   means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
   to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
   communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
   and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
   Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
   excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
   designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

   "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
   on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
   subsequently incorporated within the Work.

2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
   publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
   Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
   this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
   worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
   (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
   use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
   where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
   by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
   or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
   or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
   granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
   as of the date such litigation is filed.

4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
   Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
   modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
   meet the following conditions:

   (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
       Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

       attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
       excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
   for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
   for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
   reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
   the conditions stated in this License.

5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,

   names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
   agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
   risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

                        http://www.apache.org/licenses/

   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

   1. Definitions.

      "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
      and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

      "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
      the copyright owner that is granting the License.

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

 - boolbase@1.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

#boolbase
This very simple module provides two basic functions, one that always returns true (`trueFunc`) and one that always returns false (`falseFunc`).

###WTF?

By having only a single instance of these functions around, it's possible to do some nice optimizations. Eg. [`CSSselect`](https://github.com/fb55/CSSselect) uses these functions to determine whether a selector won't match any elements. If that's the case, the DOM doesn't even have to be touched.

###And why is this a separate module?

I'm trying to modularize `CSSselect` and most modules depend on these functions. IMHO, having a separate module is the easiest solution to this problem.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - buffer-json@2.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# buffer-json

```
npm install buffer-json
```

```js
const BJSON = require('buffer-json')

const str = BJSON.stringify({ buf: Buffer.from('hello') })
// => '{"buf":{"type":"Buffer","data":"base64:aGVsbG8="}}'

BJSON.parse(str)
// => { buf: <Buffer 68 65 6c 6c 6f> }
```

The [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html#buffer_buffer) class in Node.js is used to represent binary data. JSON does not specify a way to encode binary data, so the Node.js implementation of `JSON.stringify` represents buffers as an object of shape `{ type: "Buffer", data: [<bytes as numbers>] }`. Unfortunately, `JSON.parse` does not turn this structure back into a `Buffer` object:

```
$ node
> JSON.parse(JSON.stringify({ buf: Buffer.from('hello world') }))
{ buf:
   { type: 'Buffer',
     data: [ 104, 101, 108, 108, 111, 32, 119, 111, 114, 108, 100 ] } }
```

`JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse` accept arguments called [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) and [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) respectively which allow customizing the parsing/encoding behavior. This module provides a replacer which encodes Buffer data as a base64-encoded string, and a reviver which turns JSON objects which contain buffer-like data (either as arrays of numbers or strings) into `Buffer` instances. All other types of values are parsed/encoded as normal.

## API

### `stringify(value[, space])`

Convenience wrapper for [`JSON.stringify`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify) with the `replacer` described below.

### `parse(text)`

Convenience wrapper for [`JSON.parse`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse) with the `reviver` described below.

### `replacer(key, value)`

A [`replacer`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/stringify#The_replacer_parameter) implementation which turns every value that is a `Buffer` instance into an object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: 'base64:<base64-encoded buffer content>' }`. Empty buffers are encoded as `{ type: 'Buffer', data: '' }`.

### `reviver(key, value)`

A [`reviver`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/JSON/parse#Using_the_reviver_parameter) implementation which turns every object of shape `{ type: 'Buffer', data: <array of numbers or string> }` into a `Buffer` instance.

## Related modules

- [`buffer-json-encoding`](https://github.com/lachenmayer/buffer-json-encoding): an [`abstract-encoding`](https://github.com/mafintosh/abstract-encoding) compatible JSON encoder/decoder which uses this module.

Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and
does not provide legal services or legal advice. Distribution of
Creative Commons public licenses does not create a lawyer-client or
other relationship. Creative Commons makes its licenses and related
information available on an "as-is" basis. Creative Commons gives no

Using Creative Commons Public Licenses

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

     Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
     intended for use by those authorized to give the public
     permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
     copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
     Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
     applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
     material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
     material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
     licensed material, or material used under an exception or
     limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors

     Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
     licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
     licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
     the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
     licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
     other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
     the licensed material may still be restricted for other
     reasons, including because others have copyright or other
     rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
     such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
     Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations
     for the public:

=======================================================================

Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International Public License

By exercising the Licensed Rights (defined below), You accept and agree
to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International Public License ("Public License"). To the
extent this Public License may be interpreted as a contract, You are
granted the Licensed Rights in consideration of Your acceptance of
these terms and conditions, and the Licensor grants You such rights in
consideration of benefits the Licensor receives from making the
Licensed Material available under these terms and conditions.


Section 1 -- Definitions.

  a. Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar
     Rights that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material
     and in which the Licensed Material is translated, altered,
     arranged, transformed, or otherwise modified in a manner requiring
     permission under the Copyright and Similar Rights held by the
     Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where the Licensed
     Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
     Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is
     synched in timed relation with a moving image.

  b. Adapter's License means the license You apply to Your Copyright
     and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
     accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.

  c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
     closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
     performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
     Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
     categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
     specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
     Rights.

  d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
     absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
     fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
     Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
     agreements.

  e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or
     any other exception or limitation to Copyright and Similar Rights
     that applies to Your use of the Licensed Material.

  f. Licensed Material means the artistic or literary work, database,
     or other material to which the Licensor applied this Public
     License.

  g. Licensed Rights means the rights granted to You subject to the
     terms and conditions of this Public License, which are limited to
     all Copyright and Similar Rights that apply to Your use of the
     Licensed Material and that the Licensor has authority to license.

  h. Licensor means the individual(s) or entity(ies) granting rights
     under this Public License.

  i. Share means to provide material to the public by any means or
     process that requires permission under the Licensed Rights, such
     as reproduction, public display, public performance, distribution,
     dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
     available to the public including in ways that members of the
     public may access the material from a place and at a time
     individually chosen by them.

  j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
     resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
     the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
     as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
     equivalent rights anywhere in the world.

  k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
     under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.


Section 2 -- Scope.

  a. License grant.

       1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
          the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
          non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
          exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:

            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
               in part; and

            b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.

       2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
          Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
          License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
          its terms and conditions.

       3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
          6(a).

       4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
          Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
          all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
          and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
          necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
          technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
          Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
          simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
          (4) never produces Adapted Material.

       5. Downstream recipients.

            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
               receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
               Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
               Public License.

            b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
               any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
               apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
               Material.

       6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
          may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
          are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
          with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
          the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).

  b. Other rights.

       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
          licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
          privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
          the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
          assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
          extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
          Rights, but not otherwise.

       2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
          Public License.

       3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
          collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
          Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
          under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
          reserves any right to collect such royalties.


Section 3 -- License Conditions.

Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
following conditions.

  a. Attribution.

       1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
          form), You must:

            a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
               with the Licensed Material:

                 i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                    Material and any others designated to receive
                    attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                    the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                    designated);

                ii. a copyright notice;

               iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;

                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                    warranties;

                 v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                    extent reasonably practicable;

            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
               retain an indication of any previous modifications; and

            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
               Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
               hyperlink to, this Public License.

       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
          reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
          hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
          information.

       3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
          information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
          reasonably practicable.

       4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
          License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
          Material from complying with this Public License.


Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.

Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:

  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
     portion of the contents of the database;

  b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
     contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and

  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
     all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.


Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.

  a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
     EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
     AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
     ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
     KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
     ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
     INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
     COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
     USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

  c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
     above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
     possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
     waiver of all liability.


Section 6 -- Term and Termination.

  a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
     terminate automatically.

  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
     Section 6(a), it reinstates:

       1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
          it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
          violation; or

       2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
     of this Public License.

  c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
     Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
     will not terminate this Public License.

  d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
     License.


Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.

  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.

  b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
     Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
     independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.


Section 8 -- Interpretation.

  a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
     shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
     conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
     be made without permission under this Public License.

  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
     cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
     without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
     conditions.

  c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
     failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
     Licensor.

  d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
     as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
     that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

> A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile / FSEvents.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar.png)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chokidar)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on MacOS.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on MacOS.
* Often reports events twice.
* Emits most changes as `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/nodejs/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)
* Does not provide an easy way to recursively watch file trees.

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as bad at event handling.
* Also does not provide any recursive watching.
* Results in high CPU utilization.

Chokidar resolves these problems.

Initially made for **[Brunch](http://brunch.io)** (an ultra-swift web app build tool), it is now used in
[gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/),
[karma](http://karma-runner.github.io),
[PM2](https://github.com/Unitech/PM2),
[browserify](http://browserify.org/),
[webpack](http://webpack.github.io/),
[BrowserSync](http://www.browsersync.io/),
[Microsoft's Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode),
and [many others](https://www.npmjs.org/browse/depended/chokidar/).
It has proven itself in production environments.

## How?
Chokidar does still rely on the Node.js core `fs` module, but when using
`fs.watch` and `fs.watchFile` for watching, it normalizes the events it
receives, often checking for truth by getting file stats and/or dir contents.

On MacOS, chokidar by default uses a native extension exposing the Darwin
`FSEvents` API. This provides very efficient recursive watching compared with
implementations like `kqueue` available on most \*nix platforms. Chokidar still
does have to do some work to normalize the events received that way as well.

On other platforms, the `fs.watch`-based implementation is the default, which
avoids polling and keeps CPU usage down. Be advised that chokidar will initiate
watchers recursively for everything within scope of the paths that have been
specified, so be judicious about not wasting system resources by watching much
more than needed.

## Getting started
Install with npm:

```sh
npm install chokidar
```

Then `require` and use it in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

// One-liner for current directory, ignores .dotfiles
chokidar.watch('.', {ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../}).on('all', (event, path) => {
  console.log(event, path);
});
```

```javascript
// Example of a more typical implementation structure:

// Initialize watcher.
var watcher = chokidar.watch('file, dir, glob, or array', {
  ignored: /(^|[\/\\])\../,
  persistent: true
});

// Something to use when events are received.
var log = console.log.bind(console);
// Add event listeners.
watcher
  .on('add', path => log(`File ${path} has been added`))
  .on('change', path => log(`File ${path} has been changed`))
  .on('unlink', path => log(`File ${path} has been removed`));

// More possible events.
watcher
  .on('addDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been added`))
  .on('unlinkDir', path => log(`Directory ${path} has been removed`))
  .on('error', error => log(`Watcher error: ${error}`))
  .on('ready', () => log('Initial scan complete. Ready for changes'))
  .on('raw', (event, path, details) => {
    log('Raw event info:', event, path, details);
  });

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second
// argument when available: http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', (path, stats) => {
  if (stats) console.log(`File ${path} changed size to ${stats.size}`);
});

// Watch new files.
watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3', '**/other-file*']);

// Get list of actual paths being watched on the filesystem
var watchedPaths = watcher.getWatched();

// Un-watch some files.
watcher.unwatch('new-file*');

// Stop watching.
watcher.close();

// Full list of options. See below for descriptions. (do not use this example)
chokidar.watch('file', {
  persistent: true,

  ignored: '*.txt',
  ignoreInitial: false,
  followSymlinks: true,
  cwd: '.',
  disableGlobbing: false,

  usePolling: true,
  interval: 100,
  binaryInterval: 300,
  alwaysStat: false,
  depth: 99,
  awaitWriteFinish: {
    stabilityThreshold: 2000,
    pollInterval: 100
  },

  ignorePermissionErrors: false,
  atomic: true // or a custom 'atomicity delay', in milliseconds (default 100)
});

```

## API

`chokidar.watch(paths, [options])`

* `paths` (string or array of strings). Paths to files, dirs to be watched
recursively, or glob patterns.
* `options` (object) Options object as defined below:

#### Persistence

* `persistent` (default: `true`). Indicates whether the process
should continue to run as long as files are being watched. If set to
`false` when using `fsevents` to watch, no more events will be emitted
after `ready`, even if the process continues to run.

#### Path filtering

* `ignored` ([anymatch](https://github.com/es128/anymatch)-compatible definition)
Defines files/paths to be ignored. The whole relative or absolute path is
tested, not just filename. If a function with two arguments is provided, it
gets called twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second
time with two arguments (the path and the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object of that path).
* `ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). If set to `false` then `add`/`addDir` events are also emitted for matching paths while
instantiating the watching as chokidar discovers these file paths (before the `ready` event).
* `followSymlinks` (default: `true`). When `false`, only the
symlinks themselves will be watched for changes instead of following
the link references and bubbling events through the link's path.
* `cwd` (no default). The base directory from which watch `paths` are to be
derived. Paths emitted with events will be relative to this.
* `disableGlobbing` (default: `false`). If set to `true` then the strings passed to `.watch()` and `.add()` are treated as
literal path names, even if they look like globs.

#### Performance

* `usePolling` (default: `false`).
Whether to use fs.watchFile (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling
leads to high CPU utilization, consider setting this to `false`. It is
typically necessary to **set this to `true` to successfully watch files over
a network**, and it may be necessary to successfully watch files in other
non-standard situations. Setting to `true` explicitly on MacOS overrides the
`useFsEvents` default. You may also set the CHOKIDAR_USEPOLLING env variable
to true (1) or false (0) in order to override this option.
* _Polling-specific settings_ (effective when `usePolling: true`)
  * `interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling. You may also
    set the CHOKIDAR_INTERVAL env variable to override this option.
  * `binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
  polling for binary files.
  ([see list of binary extensions](https://github.com/sindresorhus/binary-extensions/blob/master/binary-extensions.json))
* `useFsEvents` (default: `true` on MacOS). Whether to use the
`fsevents` watching interface if available. When set to `true` explicitly
and `fsevents` is available this supercedes the `usePolling` setting. When
set to `false` on MacOS, `usePolling: true` becomes the default.
* `alwaysStat` (default: `false`). If relying upon the
[`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
object that may get passed with `add`, `addDir`, and `change` events, set
this to `true` to ensure it is provided even in cases where it wasn't
already available from the underlying watch events.
* `depth` (default: `undefined`). If set, limits how many levels of
subdirectories will be traversed.
* `awaitWriteFinish` (default: `false`).
By default, the `add` event will fire when a file first appears on disk, before
the entire file has been written. Furthermore, in some cases some `change`
events will be emitted while the file is being written. In some cases,
especially when watching for large files there will be a need to wait for the
write operation to finish before responding to a file creation or modification.
Setting `awaitWriteFinish` to `true` (or a truthy value) will poll file size,
holding its `add` and `change` events until the size does not change for a
configurable amount of time. The appropriate duration setting is heavily
dependent on the OS and hardware. For accurate detection this parameter should
be relatively high, making file watching much less responsive.
Use with caution.
  * *`options.awaitWriteFinish` can be set to an object in order to adjust
  timing params:*
  * `awaitWriteFinish.stabilityThreshold` (default: 2000). Amount of time in
  milliseconds for a file size to remain constant before emitting its event.
  * `awaitWriteFinish.pollInterval` (default: 100). File size polling interval.

#### Errors
* `ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates whether to watch files
that don't have read permissions if possible. If watching fails due to `EPERM`
or `EACCES` with this set to `true`, the errors will be suppressed silently.
* `atomic` (default: `true` if `useFsEvents` and `usePolling` are `false`).
Automatically filters out artifacts that occur when using editors that use
"atomic writes" instead of writing directly to the source file. If a file is
re-added within 100 ms of being deleted, Chokidar emits a `change` event
rather than `unlink` then `add`. If the default of 100 ms does not work well
for you, you can override it by setting `atomic` to a custom value, in
milliseconds.

### Methods & Events

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(path / paths)`: Add files, directories, or glob patterns for tracking.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `addDir`, `change`, `unlink`, `unlinkDir`, `ready`,
`raw`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted with the underlying event
name and path for every event other than `ready`, `raw`, and `error`.
* `.unwatch(path / paths)`: Stop watching files, directories, or glob patterns.
Takes an array of strings or just one string.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
* `.getWatched()`: Returns an object representing all the paths on the file
system being watched by this `FSWatcher` instance. The object's keys are all the
directories (using absolute paths unless the `cwd` option was used), and the
values are arrays of the names of the items contained in each directory.

## CLI

If you need a CLI interface for your file watching, check out
[chokidar-cli](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/chokidar-cli), allowing you to
execute a command on each change, or get a stdio stream of change events.

## Install Troubleshooting

* `npm WARN optional dep failed, continuing fsevents@n.n.n`
  * This message is normal part of how `npm` handles optional dependencies and is
    not indicative of a problem. Even if accompanied by other related error messages,
    Chokidar should function properly.

* `ERR! stack Error: Python executable "python" is v3.4.1, which is not supported by gyp.`
  * You should be able to resolve this by installing python 2.7 and running:
    `npm config set python python2.7`

* `gyp ERR! stack Error: not found: make`
  * On Mac, install the XCode command-line tools

[![npm version][npm-version-src]][npm-version-href]
[![npm downloads][npm-downloads-src]][npm-downloads-href]
[![package phobia][package-phobia-src]][package-phobia-href]
[![bundle phobia][bundle-phobia-src]][bundle-phobia-href]

## Why Consola?

üëå&nbsp; Easy to use<br>
üíÖ&nbsp; Fancy output with fallback for minimal environments<br>
üîå&nbsp; Pluggable reporters<br>
üíª&nbsp; Consistent command line interface (CLI) experience<br>
üè∑&nbsp; Tag support<br>
üöè&nbsp; Redirect `console` and `stdout/stderr` to consola and easily restore redirect.<br>
üåê&nbsp; Browser support<br>
‚èØ&nbsp; Pause/Resume support<br>
üëª&nbsp; Mocking support<br>
üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è&nbsp; Spam prevention by throttling logs<br>

## Installation

Using yarn:

```bash
yarn add consola
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm i consola
```

## Getting Started

```js
const consola = require('consola')

// See types section for all available types

consola.success('Built!')
consola.info('Reporter: Some info')
consola.error(new Error('Foo'))
```

Will display in the terminal:

![Screenshot 2020-01-28 at 14 15 15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/904724/73267133-af6b2f00-41d8-11ea-9f16-4a8243d19c43.png)

**NOTE:** Alternatively, you can import consola from source. But don't forget to whitelist it for transpilation:

```js
import consola from 'consola/src/node'
import consola from 'consola/src/browser'
```

## Methods

#### `<type>(logObject)` `<type>(args...)`

Log to all reporters.

Example: `consola.info('Message')`

A list of available types can be found [here](./src/types.js).

#### `addReporter(reporter)`

- Aliases: `add`

Register a custom reporter instance.

#### `removeReporter(reporter?)`

- Aliases: `remove`, `clear`

Remove a registered reporter.

If no arguments are passed all reporters will be removed.

#### `setReporters(reporter|reporter[])`

Replace all reporters.

#### `create(options)`

Create a new `Consola` instance and inherit all parent options for defaults.

#### `withDefaults(defaults)`

Create a new `Consola` instance with provided defaults

#### `withTag(tag)`

- Aliases: `withScope`

Create a new `Consola` instance with that tag.

#### `wrapConsole()` `restoreConsole()`

Globally redirect all `console.log`, etc calls to consola handlers.

#### `wrapStd()` `restoreStd()`

Globally redirect all stdout/stderr outputs to consola.

#### `wrapAll()` `restoreAll()`

Wrap both, std and console.

console uses std in the underlying so calling `wrapStd` redirects console too.
Benefit of this function is that things like `console.info` will be correctly redirected to the corresponding type.

#### `pauseLogs()` `resumeLogs()`

- Aliases: `pause`/`resume`

**Globally** pause and resume logs.

Consola will enqueue all logs when paused and then sends them to the reported when resumed.

#### `mockTypes`

- Aliases: `mock`

Mock all types. Useful for using with tests.

The first argument passed to `mockTypes` should be a callback function accepting `(typeName, type)` and returning the mocked value:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName, type) => jest.fn())
```

Please note that with the example above, everything is mocked independently for each type. If you need one mocked fn create it outside:

```js
const fn = jest.fn()
consola.mockTypes(() => fn)
```

If callback function returns a _falsy_ value, that type won't be mocked.

For example if you just need to mock `consola.fatal`:

```js
consola.mockTypes((typeName) => typeName === 'fatal' && jest.fn())
```

**NOTE:** Any instance of consola that inherits the mocked instance, will apply provided callback again.
This way, mocking works for `withTag` scoped loggers without need to extra efforts.

## Fields

#### `reporters`

An array of active reporters.

#### `level`

The level to display logs. Any logs at or above this level will be displayed.
List of available levels [here](./src/types.js).

You can set the log level using the `CONSOLA_LEVEL` environment variable, which must have the numeric log level as its value.

## `logObject`

The `logObject` is a free-to-extend object which will be passed to reporters.

Standard fields:

- `message`
- `additional`
- `args`
- `date`
- `tag`

Extra fields:

- `badge`

## Reporters

Choose between one of the built-in reporters or bring in your own one.

By default `FancyReporter` is registered for modern terminals or `BasicReporter` will be used if running in limited environments such as CIs.

Available reporters:

- [BasicReporter](./src/reporters/basic.js)
- [FancyReporter](./src/reporters/fancy.js)
- [JSONReporter](./src/reporters/json.js)
- [WinstonReporter](./src/reporters/winston.js)

### Creating your own reporter

A reporter (class or object) exposes `log(logObj)` method.
To get more info about how to write your own reporter, take a look into the linked implementations above.

## Types

Types are used to actually log messages to the reporters.
Each type is attached to a _logging level_.

A list of all available default types is [here](./src/types.js).

## Creating a new instance

Consola has a global instance and is recommended to use everywhere.
In case more control is needed, create a new instance.

```js
import consola from 'consola'

const logger = consola.create({
    // level: 4,
    reporters: [
      new consola.JSONReporter()
    ],
    defaults: {
      additionalColor: 'white'
    }
})
```

## Integrations

### With jest

```js
describe('your-consola-mock-test', () => {
  beforeAll(() => {
      // Redirect std and console to consola too
      // Calling this once is sufficient
      consola.wrapAll()
    })

    beforeEach(() => {
      // Re-mock consola before each test call to remove
      // calls from before
      consola.mockTypes(() => jest.fn())
    })


  test('your test', async () => {
    // Some code here

    // Let's retrieve all messages of `consola.log`
    // Get the mock and map all calls to their first argument
    const consolaMessages = consola.log.mock.calls.map(c => c[0])
    expect(consolaMessages).toContain('your message')
  })

})
```

### With jsdom

```js
{
  virtualConsole: new jsdom.VirtualConsole().sendTo(consola)
}
```

__NOTE__: you must still install the engines you wish to use, add them to your package.json dependencies.

## API

  All templates supported by this library may be rendered using the signature `(path[, locals], callback)` as shown below, which happens to be the signature that Express 3.x supports so any of these engines may be used within Express.

__NOTE__: All this example code uses cons.swig for the swig template engine. Replace swig with whatever templating you are using. For example, use cons.hogan for hogan.js, cons.jade for jade, etc. `console.log(cons)` for the full list of identifiers.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

  Or without options / local variables:

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');
cons.swig('views/page.html', function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

  To dynamically pass the engine, simply use the subscript operator and a variable:

```js
var cons = require('consolidate')
  , name = 'swig';

cons[name]('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' }, function(err, html){
  if (err) throw err;
  console.log(html);
});
```

### Promises

  Additionally, all templates optionally return a promise if no callback function is provided. The promise represents the eventual result of the template function which will either resolve to a string, compiled from the template, or be rejected. Promises expose a `then` method which registers callbacks to receive the promise‚Äôs eventual value and a `catch` method which the reason why the promise could not be fulfilled. Promises allow more synchronous-like code structure and solve issues like race conditions.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate');

cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi' })
  .then(function (html) {
    console.log(html);
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    throw err;
  });
```

## Caching

 To enable caching simply pass `{ cache: true }`. Engines _may_ use this option to cache things reading the file contents, compiled `Function`s etc. Engines which do _not_ support this may simply ignore it. All engines that consolidate.js implements I/O for will cache the file contents, ideal for production environments.
 When using consolidate directly: `cons.swig('views/page.html', { user: 'tobi', cache:true }, callback);`
 Using Express 3 or higher: `app.locals.cache = true` or set NODE_ENV to 'production' and Express will do this for you.

## Express 3.x example

```js
var express = require('express')
  , cons = require('consolidate')
  , app = express();

// assign the swig engine to .html files
app.engine('html', cons.swig);

// set .html as the default extension
app.set('view engine', 'html');
app.set('views', __dirname + '/views');

var users = [];
users.push({ name: 'tobi' });
users.push({ name: 'loki' });
users.push({ name: 'jane' });

app.get('/', function(req, res){
  res.render('index', {
    title: 'Consolidate.js'
  });
});

app.get('/users', function(req, res){
  res.render('users', {
    title: 'Users',
    users: users
  });
});

app.listen(3000);
console.log('Express server listening on port 3000');
```

## Template Engine Instances

Template engines are exposed via the `cons.requires` object, but they are not instantiated until you've called the `cons[engine].render()` method. You can instantiate them manually beforehand if you want to add filters, globals, mixins, or other engine features.

```js
var cons = require('consolidate'),
  nunjucks = require('nunjucks');

// add nunjucks to requires so filters can be
// added and the same instance will be used inside the render method
cons.requires.nunjucks = nunjucks.configure();

cons.requires.nunjucks.addFilter('foo', function () {
  return 'bar';
});
```

## Notes

* If you're using Nunjucks, please take a look at the `exports.nunjucks.render` function in `lib.consolidate.js`.  You can pass your own engine/environment via `options.nunjucksEnv`, or if you want to support Express you can pass `options.settings.views`, or if you have another use case, pass `options.nunjucks` (see the code for more insight).
* You can pass **partials** with `options.partials`
* For using **template inheritance** with nunjucks, you can pass a loader
  with `options.loader`.
* To use **filters** with tinyliquid, use `options.filters` and specify an array of properties, each of which is a named filter function. A filter function takes a string as a parameter and returns a modified version of it.
* To use **custom tags** with tinyliquid, use `options.customTags` to specify an array of tag functions that follow the tinyliquid [custom tag](https://github.com/leizongmin/tinyliquid/wiki/Custom-Tag) definition.
* The default directory used with the **include** tag with tinyliquid is the current working directory. To override this, use `options.includeDir`.
* `React` To render content into a html base template (eg. `index.html` of your React app), pass the path of the template with `options.base`.

This package contains the following license and notice below:

css-color-names
===============

A JSON Object of css color names mapped to their hex value

Usage
-----

``` js
var csscolors = require('css-color-names');
console.dir(csscolors);
```

yields

``` json
{
  "aqua": "#00ffff",
  "aliceblue": "#f0f8ff",
  "antiquewhite": "#faebd7",
  "black": "#000000",
  "blue": "#0000ff",
  ...
}
```

How was this list generated?
----------------------------

In the Makefile you'll see a line like this:

	./getcolors.sh | ./stringify.js > $(FILE)

The first command scrapes a site for the list,
and outputs the results separated by newlines.  The
second command creates the JSON object and outputs
it to stdout, which then gets redirected into
`css-color-names.json`

Installation
------------

    npm install css-color-names

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# CC0 1.0 Universal

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an ‚Äúowner‚Äù) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a ‚ÄúWork‚Äù).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(‚ÄúCommons‚Äù) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the ‚ÄúAffirmer‚Äù), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (‚ÄúCopyright and
   Related Rights‚Äù). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
      communicate, and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person‚Äôs image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
      in a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer‚Äôs Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the ‚ÄúWaiver‚Äù). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer‚Äôs heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer‚Äôs express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer‚Äôs express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free, non
transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
license to exercise Affirmer‚Äôs Copyright and Related Rights in the Work (i) in
all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable
law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose
whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
purposes (the ‚ÄúLicense‚Äù). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date
CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i)
exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work
or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer‚Äôs express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
      warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory
      or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any person‚Äôs Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to

# C-like unsigned integers for Javascript

## Synopsis

Javascript does not natively support handling of unsigned 32 or 64 bits integers. This library provides that functionality, following C behaviour, enabling the writing of algorithms that depend on it. It was designed with performance in mind and tries its best to be as fast as possible. Any improvement is welcome!


## How it works

An unsigned 32 bits integer is represented by an object with its first 16 bits (low bits) and its 16 last ones (high bits). All the supported standard operations on the unsigned integer are then performed transparently.

	e.g.
	10000010000100000100010000100010 (2182104098 or 0x82104422) is represented by:
	high=1000001000010000
	low= 0100010000100010

NB.
In case of overflow, the unsigned integer is _truncated_ to its lowest 32 bits (in case of UINT32) or 64  bits (in case of UINT64).

The same applies to 64 bits integers, which are split into 4 16 bits ones.

## Installation

In nodejs:

    npm install cuint

In the browser, include the following (file is located in the _build_ directory), and access the constructor with _UINT32_:

`<script src="/your/path/to/uint32.js"></script>
...
<script type="text/javascript">
  var v1 = UINT32('326648991');
  var v2 = UINT32('265443576');
  var v1plus2 = v1.add(v2) // 592092567
</script>`

## Usage

To instantiate an unsigned 32 bits integer, do any of the following:

	var UINT32 = require('cuint').UINT32 // NodeJS
	UINT32( <low bits>, <high bits> )
	UINT32( <number> )
	UINT32( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default

To instantiate an unsigned 64 bits integer, do any of the following:

	var UINT64 = require('cuint').UINT64 // NodeJS
	UINT64( <low bits>, <high bits> )
	UINT64( <first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits> )
	UINT64( <number> )
	UINT64( '<number>', <radix> ) // radix = 10 by default

## Important

Most methods __do modify__ the object they are applied to. For instance, the following is equivalent to `x += y`

	UINT(x).add( UINT(y) )

This allows for chaining and reduces the cost of the emulation.
To have `z = x + y`, do the following:

    z = UINT(x).clone().add( UINT(y) )

## Examples for UINT32

* Using low and high bits
> `UINT32( 2, 1 )		// 65538`
> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }

* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)
> `UINT32( 65538 ) 	// 65538`
> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }

* Using a string
> `UINT32( '65538' )	// 65538`
> { remainder: null, _low: 2, _high: 1 }

* Using another string
> `UINT32( '3266489917' )`
> { remainder: null, _low: 44605, _high: 49842 }

* Divide 2 unsigned 32 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided
> `UINT32( '3266489917' ).div( UINT32( '668265263' ) )`
> {	remainder:
>			{	remainder: null
>			,	_low: 385
>			,	_high: 9055
>			}
>	,	_low: 4
>	,	_high: 0
>	}

## Examples for UINT64

* Using low and high bits
> `UINT64( 2, 1 )		// 4294967298`
> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 0, _a32: 1, _a48: 0 }

* Using first/second low and high bits
> `UINT64( 2, 1, 0, 0 )		// 65538`
> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }

* Using a number (signed 32 bits integer)
> `UINT64( 65538 ) 	// 65538`
> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }

* Using a string
> `UINT64( '65538' )	// 65538`
> { remainder: null, _a00: 2, _a16: 1, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }

* Using another string
> `UINT64( '3266489917' )`
> { remainder: null, _a00: 44605, _a16: 49842, _a32: 0, _a48: 0 }

* Divide 2 unsigned 64 bits integers - note that the remainder is also provided
> `UINT64( 'F00000000000', 16 ).div( UINT64( '800000000000', 16 ) )`
> { remainder: 
>   { remainder: null,
>     _a00: 0,
>     _a16: 0,
>     _a32: 28672,
>     _a48: 0 },
>  _a00: 1,
>  _a16: 0,
>  _a32: 0,
>  _a48: 0 }

## Methods

Methods specific to _UINT32_ and _UINT64_:

* `UINT32.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`
Set the current _UINT32_ object with its low and high bits
* `UINT64.fromBits(<low bits>, <high bits>)*`
Set the current _UINT64_ object with its low and high bits
* `UINT64.fromBits(<first low bits>, <second low bits>, <first high bits>, <second high bits>)*`
Set the current _UINT64_ object with all its low and high bits

* `UINT.fromNumber(<number>)*`
Set the current _UINT_ object from a number (first 32 bits only)
* `UINT.fromString(<string>, <radix>)`
Set the current _UINT_ object from a string
* `UINT.toNumber()`
Convert this _UINT_ to a number

Fast elliptic-curve cryptography in a plain javascript implementation.

NOTE: Please take a look at http://safecurves.cr.yp.to/ before choosing a curve
for your cryptography operations.

## Incentive

ECC is much slower than regular RSA cryptography, the JS implementations are
even more slower.

## API

### ECDSA

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;

// Create and initialize EC context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EC('secp256k1');

// Generate keys
var key = ec.genKeyPair();

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash);

// Export DER encoded signature in Array
var derSign = signature.toDER();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, derSign));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

var pubPoint = key.getPublic();
var x = pubPoint.getX();
var y = pubPoint.getY();

// Public Key MUST be either:
// 1) '04' + hex string of x + hex string of y; or
// 2) object with two hex string properties (x and y); or
// 3) object with two buffer properties (x and y)
var pub = pubPoint.encode('hex');                                 // case 1
var pub = { x: x.toString('hex'), y: y.toString('hex') };         // case 2
var pub = { x: x.toBuffer(), y: y.toBuffer() };                   // case 3
var pub = { x: x.toArrayLike(Buffer), y: y.toArrayLike(Buffer) }; // case 3

// Import public key
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Signature MUST be either:
// 1) DER-encoded signature as hex-string; or
// 2) DER-encoded signature as buffer; or
// 3) object with two hex-string properties (r and s); or
// 4) object with two buffer properties (r and s)

var signature = '3046022100...'; // case 1
var signature = new Buffer('...'); // case 2
var signature = { r: 'b1fc...', s: '9c42...' }; // case 3

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### EdDSA

```javascript
var EdDSA = require('elliptic').eddsa;

// Create and initialize EdDSA context
// (better do it once and reuse it)
var ec = new EdDSA('ed25519');

// Create key pair from secret
var key = ec.keyFromSecret('693e3c...'); // hex string, array or Buffer

// Sign the message's hash (input must be an array, or a hex-string)
var msgHash = [ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 ];
var signature = key.sign(msgHash).toHex();

// Verify signature
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));

// CHECK WITH NO PRIVATE KEY

// Import public key
var pub = '0a1af638...';
var key = ec.keyFromPublic(pub, 'hex');

// Verify signature
var signature = '70bed1...';
console.log(key.verify(msgHash, signature));
```

### ECDH

```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

// Generate keys
var key1 = ec.genKeyPair();
var key2 = ec.genKeyPair();

var shared1 = key1.derive(key2.getPublic());
var shared2 = key2.derive(key1.getPublic());

console.log('Both shared secrets are BN instances');
console.log(shared1.toString(16));
console.log(shared2.toString(16));
```

three and more members:
```javascript
var EC = require('elliptic').ec;
var ec = new EC('curve25519');

var A = ec.genKeyPair();
var B = ec.genKeyPair();
var C = ec.genKeyPair();

var AB = A.getPublic().mul(B.getPrivate())
var BC = B.getPublic().mul(C.getPrivate())
var CA = C.getPublic().mul(A.getPrivate())

var ABC = AB.mul(C.getPrivate())
var BCA = BC.mul(A.getPrivate())
var CAB = CA.mul(B.getPrivate())

console.log(ABC.getX().toString(16))
console.log(BCA.getX().toString(16))
console.log(CAB.getX().toString(16))
```

NOTE: `.derive()` returns a [BN][1] instance.

## Supported curves

Elliptic.js support following curve types:

* Short Weierstrass
* Montgomery
* Edwards
* Twisted Edwards

Following curve 'presets' are embedded into the library:

* `secp256k1`
* `p192`
* `p224`
* `p256`
* `p384`
* `p521`
* `curve25519`
* `ed25519`

NOTE: That `curve25519` could not be used for ECDSA, use `ed25519` instead.

### Implementation details

ECDSA is using deterministic `k` value generation as per [RFC6979][0]. Most of
the curve operations are performed on non-affine coordinates (either projective
or extended), various windowing techniques are used for different cases.

All operations are performed in reduction context using [bn.js][1], hashing is
provided by [hash.js][2]

### Related projects

* [eccrypto][3]: isomorphic implementation of ECDSA, ECDH and ECIES for both
  browserify and node (uses `elliptic` for browser and [secp256k1-node][4] for
  node)

<a name="errnoexposed"></a>
## errno exposed

Ever find yourself needing more details about Node.js errors? Me too, so *node-errno* contains the errno mappings direct from libuv so you can use them in your code.

**By errno:**

```js
require('errno').errno[3]
// ‚Üí {
//     "errno": 3,
//     "code": "EACCES",
//     "description": "permission denied"
//   }
```

**By code:**

```js
require('errno').code.ENOTEMPTY
// ‚Üí {
//     "errno": 53,
//     "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
//     "description": "directory not empty"
//   }
```

**Make your errors more descriptive:**

```js
var errno = require('errno')

function errmsg(err) {
  var str = 'Error: '
  // if it's a libuv error then get the description from errno
  if (errno.errno[err.errno])
    str += errno.errno[err.errno].description
  else
    str += err.message

  // if it's a `fs` error then it'll have a 'path' property
  if (err.path)
    str += ' [' + err.path + ']'

  return str
}

var fs = require('fs')

fs.readFile('thisisnotarealfile.txt', function (err, data) {
  if (err)
    console.log(errmsg(err))
})
```

**Use as a command line tool:**

```
~ $ errno 53
{
  "errno": 53,
  "code": "ENOTEMPTY",
  "description": "directory not empty"
}
~ $ errno EROFS
{
  "errno": 56,
  "code": "EROFS",
  "description": "read-only file system"
}
~ $ errno foo
No such errno/code: "foo"
```

Supply no arguments for the full list. Error codes are processed case-insensitive.

You will need to install with `npm install errno -g` if you want the `errno` command to be available without supplying a full path to the node_modules installation.

<a name="customerrors"></a>
## Custom errors

Use `errno.custom.createError()` to create custom `Error` objects to throw around in your Node.js library. Create error hierarchies so `instanceof` becomes a useful tool in tracking errors. Call-stack is correctly captured at the time you create an instance of the error object, plus a `cause` property will make available the original error object if you pass one in to the constructor.

```js
var create = require('errno').custom.createError
var MyError = create('MyError') // inherits from Error
var SpecificError = create('SpecificError', MyError) // inherits from MyError
var OtherError = create('OtherError', MyError)

// use them!
if (condition) throw new SpecificError('Eeek! Something bad happened')

if (err) return callback(new OtherError(err))
```

Also available is a `errno.custom.FilesystemError` with in-built access to errno properties:

```js
fs.readFile('foo', function (err, data) {
  if (err) return callback(new errno.custom.FilesystemError(err))
  // do something else
})
```

The resulting error object passed through the callback will have the following properties: `code`, `errno`, `path` and `message` will contain a descriptive human-readable message.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - esrecurse@4.3.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

### Esrecurse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/estools/esrecurse)

Esrecurse ([esrecurse](https://github.com/estools/esrecurse)) is
[ECMAScript](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm)
recursive traversing functionality.

### Example Usage

The following code will output all variables declared at the root of a file.

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(ast, {
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});
```

We can use `Visitor` instance.

```javascript
var visitor = new esrecurse.Visitor({
    XXXStatement: function (node) {
        this.visit(node.left);
        // do something...
        this.visit(node.right);
    }
});

visitor.visit(ast);
```

We can inherit `Visitor` instance easily.

```javascript
class Derived extends esrecurse.Visitor {
    constructor()
    {
        super(null);
    }

    XXXStatement(node) {
    }
}
```

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    this.visit(node.left);
    // do something...
    this.visit(node.right);
};
```

And you can invoke default visiting operation inside custom visit operation.

```javascript
function DerivedVisitor() {
    esrecurse.Visitor.call(/* this for constructor */  this  /* visitor object automatically becomes this. */);
}
util.inherits(DerivedVisitor, esrecurse.Visitor);
DerivedVisitor.prototype.XXXStatement = function (node) {
    // do something...
    this.visitChildren(node);
};
```

The `childVisitorKeys` option does customize the behaviour of `this.visitChildren(node)`.
We can use user-defined node types.

```javascript
// This tree contains a user-defined `TestExpression` node.
var tree = {
    type: 'TestExpression',

    // This 'argument' is the property containing the other **node**.
    argument: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: 20
    },

    // This 'extended' is the property not containing the other **node**.
    extended: true
};
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        // Extending the existing traversing rules.
        childVisitorKeys: {
            // TargetNodeName: [ 'keys', 'containing', 'the', 'other', '**node**' ]
            TestExpression: ['argument']
        }
    }
);
```

We can use the `fallback` option as well.
If the `fallback` option is `"iteration"`, `esrecurse` would visit all enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: 'iteration'
    }
);
```

If the `fallback` option is a function, `esrecurse` calls this function to determine the enumerable properties of unknown nodes.
Please note circular references cause the stack overflow. AST might have circular references in additional properties for some purpose (e.g. `node.parent`).

```javascript
esrecurse.visit(
    ast,
    {
        Literal: function (node) {
            // do something...
        }
    },
    {
        fallback: function (node) {
            return Object.keys(node).filter(function(key) {
                return key !== 'argument'
            });
        }
    }
);
```

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - imurmurhash@0.1.4

This package contains the following license and notice below:

iMurmurHash.js
==============

An incremental implementation of the MurmurHash3 (32-bit) hashing algorithm for JavaScript based on [Gary Court's implementation](https://github.com/garycourt/murmurhash-js) with [kazuyukitanimura's modifications](https://github.com/kazuyukitanimura/murmurhash-js).

This version works significantly faster than the non-incremental version if you need to hash many small strings into a single hash, since string concatenation (to build the single string to pass the non-incremental version) is fairly costly. In one case tested, using the incremental version was about 50% faster than concatenating 5-10 strings and then hashing.

Installation
------------

To use iMurmurHash in the browser, [download the latest version](https://raw.github.com/jensyt/imurmurhash-js/master/imurmurhash.min.js) and include it as a script on your site.

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="/scripts/imurmurhash.min.js"></script>
<script>
// Your code here, access iMurmurHash using the global object MurmurHash3
</script>
```

---

To use iMurmurHash in Node.js, install the module using NPM:

```bash
npm install imurmurhash
```

Then simply include it in your scripts:

```javascript
MurmurHash3 = require('imurmurhash');
```

Quick Example
-------------

```javascript
// Create the initial hash
var hashState = MurmurHash3('string');

// Incrementally add text
hashState.hash('more strings');
hashState.hash('even more strings');

// All calls can be chained if desired
hashState.hash('and').hash('some').hash('more');

// Get a result
hashState.result();
// returns 0xe4ccfe6b
```

Functions
---------

### MurmurHash3 ([string], [seed])
Get a hash state object, optionally initialized with the given _string_ and _seed_. _Seed_ must be a positive integer if provided. Calling this function without the `new` keyword will return a cached state object that has been reset. This is safe to use as long as the object is only used from a single thread and no other hashes are created while operating on this one. If this constraint cannot be met, you can use `new` to create a new state object. For example:

```javascript
// Use the cached object, calling the function again will return the same
// object (but reset, so the current state would be lost)
hashState = MurmurHash3();
...

// Create a new object that can be safely used however you wish. Calling the
// function again will simply return a new state object, and no state loss
// will occur, at the cost of creating more objects.
hashState = new MurmurHash3();
```

Both methods can be mixed however you like if you have different use cases.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.hash (string)
Incrementally add _string_ to the hash. This can be called as many times as you want for the hash state object, including after a call to `result()`. Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.result ()
Get the result of the hash as a 32-bit positive integer. This performs the tail and finalizer portions of the algorithm, but does not store the result in the state object. This means that it is perfectly safe to get results and then continue adding strings via `hash`.

```javascript
// Do the whole string at once
MurmurHash3('this is a test string').result();
// 0x70529328

// Do part of the string, get a result, then the other part
var m = MurmurHash3('this is a');
m.result();
// 0xbfc4f834
m.hash(' test string').result();
// 0x70529328 (same as above)
```

---

### MurmurHash3.prototype.reset ([seed])
Reset the state object for reuse, optionally using the given _seed_ (defaults to 0 like the constructor). Returns `this` so calls can be chained.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - intersection-observer@0.12.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# `IntersectionObserver` polyfill

This library polyfills the native [`IntersectionObserver`](http://w3c.github.io/IntersectionObserver/) API in unsupporting browsers. See the [API documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API) for usage information.

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Configuring the polyfill](#configuring-the-polyfill)
- [Limitations](#limitations)
- [Browser support](#browser-support)
- [Running the tests](#running-the-tests)

## Installation

You can install the polyfill via npm or by downloading a [zip](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/archive/gh-pages.zip) of this repository:

```sh
npm install intersection-observer
```

### Adding the polyfill to your site

The examples below show various ways to add the `IntersectionObserver` polyfill to your site. Be sure to include the polyfill prior to referencing it anywhere in your JavaScript code.

**Using `<script>` tags in the HTML:**

```html
<!-- Load the polyfill first. -->
<script src="path/to/intersection-observer.js"></script>

<!-- Load all other JavaScript. -->
<script src="app.js"></script>
```

**Using a module loader (e.g. Browserify or Webpack):**

```js
// Require the polyfill before requiring any other modules.
require('intersection-observer');

require('./foo.js');
require('./bar.js');
```

## Configuring the polyfill

It's impossible to handle all possible ways a target element could intersect with a root element without resorting to constantly polling the document for intersection changes.

To avoid this extra work and performance penalty, the default configuration of the polyfill optimizes for the most common `IntersectionObserver` use cases, which primarily include target elements intersecting with a root element due to:

- User scrolling.
- Resizing the window.
- Changes to the DOM.

All of the above can be handled without polling the DOM.

There are, however, additional use cases that the default configuration will not detect. These include target elements intersecting with a root element due to:

- CSS changes on `:hover`, `:active`, or `:focus` states.
- CSS changes due to transitions or animations with a long initial delay.
- Resizable `<textarea>` elements that cause other elements to move around.
- Scrolling of non-document elements in browsers that don't support the event capture phase.

If you need to handle any of these use-cases, you can configure the polyfill to poll the document by setting the `POLL_INTERVAL` property. This can be set either globally or on a per-instance basis.

**Enabling polling for all instance:**

To enable polling for all instance, set a value for `POLL_INTERVAL` on the `IntersectionObserver` prototype:


```js
IntersectionObserver.prototype.POLL_INTERVAL = 100; // Time in milliseconds.
```

**Enabling polling for individual instance:**

To enable polling on only specific instances, set a `POLL_INTERVAL` value on the instance itself:

```js
var io = new IntersectionObserver(callback);
io.POLL_INTERVAL = 100; // Time in milliseconds.
io.observe(someTargetElement);
```

**Note:** the `POLL_INTERVAL` property must be set prior to calling the `.observe` method, or the default configuration will be used.

**Ignoring DOM changes**

You can also choose to not check for intersections when the DOM changes by setting an observer's `USE_MUTATION_OBSERVER` property to `false` (either globally on the prototype or per-instance)

```js
IntersectionObserver.prototype.USE_MUTATION_OBSERVER = false; // Globally

// for an instance
var io = new IntersectionObserver(callback);
io.USE_MUTATION_OBSERVER = false;
```

This is recommended in cases where the DOM will update frequently but you know those updates will have no affect on the position or your target elements.


## iframe support

### Same-origin iframes

Same-origin iframes are supported by the polyfill out of the box.


### Cross-origin iframes

Additional code and configuration are required to support cross-origin iframes,
both on the iframe and host sides.

The setup is as following:

1. The host and iframe will establish a messaging channel.
2. The host will setup its own IntersectionObserver instance for the
cross-origin iframe element. It can either use the this polyfill or any other
approach. For each IntersectionObserverEntry for the iframe it will forward
intersection data to the iframe via messaging.
3. The iframe will load the polyfill and configure it by calling the
`_setupCrossOriginUpdater()` method. It will call the provided callback
whenever it receives the intersection data from the the parent via messaging.

A hypothetical host code:

```javascript
function forwardIntersectionToIframe(iframe) {
  createMessagingChannel(iframe, function(port) {
    var io = new IntersectionObserver(function() {
      port.postMessage({
        boundingClientRect: serialize(boundingClientRect),
        intersectionRect: serialize(intersectionRect)
      });
    }, {threshold: [0, 0.1, ..., 1]});
    io.observe(iframe);
  });
}
```

Notice that the host should provide a `threshold` argument for the desired
level of precision. Otherwise, the iframe side may not update as frequently as
desired.

A hypothetical iframe code:

```javascript
createMessagingChannel(parent, function(port) {
  if (IntersectionObserver._setupCrossOriginUpdater) {
    var crossOriginUpdater = IntersectionObserver._setupCrossOriginUpdater();
    port.onmessage = function(event) {
      crossOriginUpdater(
        deserialize(event.data.boundingClientRect),
        deserialize(event.data.intersectionRect)
      );
    };
  }
});
```


## Limitations

This polyfill does not support the [proposed v2 additions](https://github.com/szager-chromium/IntersectionObserver/blob/v2/explainer.md), as these features are not currently possible to do with JavaScript and existing web APIs.

## Browser support

The polyfill has been tested and known to work in the latest version of all browsers.

Legacy support is also possible in very old browsers by including a shim for ES5 as well as the `window.getComputedStyle` method. The easiest way to load the IntersectionObserver polyfill and have it work in the widest range of browsers is via [polyfill.io](https://cdn.polyfill.io/v3/), which will automatically include dependencies where necessary:

```html
<script src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=IntersectionObserver"></script>
```

With these polyfills, `IntersectionObserver` has been tested an known to work in the following browsers:

## Running the tests

To run the test suite for the `IntersectionObserver` polyfill, open the [`intersection-observer-test.html`](./intersection-observer-test.html) page in the browser of your choice.

If you run the tests in a browser that support `IntersectionObserver` natively, the tests will be run against the native implementation. If it doesn't the tests will be run against the polyfill.

The following NPM packages may be included in this product:

 - mdn-data@2.0.14
 - mdn-data@2.0.4

These packages each contain the following license and notice below:

CC0 1.0 Universal

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific
works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear of later
claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse
and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any
purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may
contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the
further production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain
reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and
efforts of others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation
of additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work
and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
to, the following:

  i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
  and translate a Work;

  ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);

  iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness
  depicted in a Work;

  iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
  subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;

  v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
  a Work;

  vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
  European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
  protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
  including any amended or successor version of such directive); and

  vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
  based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmer's Copyright
and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes
the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and to the
detriment of Affirmer's heirs and successors, fully intending that such Waiver
shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or
any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work
by the public as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the Waiver
is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a royalty-free,
non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and
unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights in
the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration
provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time extensions), (iii)
in any current or future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial, advertising or
promotional purposes (the "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as
of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
License for any reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under
applicable law, such partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not
invalidate the remainder of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby
affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims
and causes of action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to
Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.

  a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
  surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.

  b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
  of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise,
  including without limitation warranties of title, merchantability, fitness
  for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the absence of latent or
  other defects, accuracy, or the present or absence of errors, whether or not
  discoverable, all to the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.

  c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
  that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without limitation
  any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer
  disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents, permissions
  or other rights required for any use of the Work.

  d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
  party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
  CC0 or use of the Work.

`node-res` is a simple module to make HTTP response in Node.js. It offers helpers to make it easier to set `headers`, define response statuses and properly parse response type to set appropriate headers.

For example:

```js
// content-type: plain/text
nodeRes.send(req, res, 'Hello world')

// content-type: application/json
nodeRes.send(req, res, { greeting: 'hello world' })
    
// content-type: text/html
nodeRes.send(req, res, '<h2> Hello world </h2>')
```

## See also

1. [node-req](https://npmjs.org/package/node-req)
2. [node-cookie](https://npmjs.org/package/node-cookie)

## Basic Example

```javascript
const http = require('http')
const nodeRes = require('node-res')

http.createServer(function (req, res) {
  
  // plain text
  nodeRes.send(req, res, "Hello world")

  // json
  nodeRes.json(req, res, {time:"now"})

  // jsonp
  nodeRes.jsonp(req, res, {time:"now"}, "callback")

}).listen(3000)

```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - pnp-webpack-plugin@1.7.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/webpack/media/master/logo/icon-square-small.png" height="40" align="right" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for Webpack

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/pnp-webpack-plugin.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pnp-webpack-plugin)

*This plugin is also available for Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve)), and TypeScript ([ts-pnp](https://github.com/arcanis/ts-pnp))*

## Installation

```
yarn add -D pnp-webpack-plugin
```

## Usage

Simply add the plugin to both the `resolver` and `resolveLoader`:

```js
const PnpWebpackPlugin = require(`pnp-webpack-plugin`);

module.exports = {
  resolve: {
    plugins: [
      PnpWebpackPlugin,
    ],
  },
  resolveLoader: {
    plugins: [
      PnpWebpackPlugin.moduleLoader(module),
    ],
  },
};
```

The `resolve` entry will take care of correctly resolving the dependencies required by your program, and the `resolveLoader` entry will help Webpack find the location of the loaders on the disk. Note that in this case, all loaders will be resolved relative to the package containing your configuration.

In case part of your configuration comes from third-party packages that use their own loaders, make sure they use `require.resolve` - this will ensure that the resolution process is portable accross environments (including when Plug'n'Play isn't enabled), and prevent it from relying on undefined behaviors:

```js
module.exports = {
  module: {
    rules: [{
      test: /\.js$/,
      loader: require.resolve('babel-loader'),
    }]
  },
};
```

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"

      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - run-queue@1.0.3

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# run-queue

A promise based, dynamic priority queue runner, with concurrency limiting.

```js
const RunQueue = require('run-queue')

const queue = new RunQueue({
  maxConcurrency: 1
})

queue.add(1, example, [-1])
for (let ii = 0; ii < 5; ++ii) {
  queue.add(0, example, [ii])
}
const finished = []
queue.run().then(
  console.log(finished)
})

function example (num, next) {
  setTimeout(() => {
    finished.push(num)
    next()
  }, 5 - Math.abs(num))
}
```

would output

```
[ 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, -1 ]
```

If you bump concurrency to `2`, then you get:

```
[ 1, 0, 3, 2, 4, -1 ]
```

The concurrency means that they don't finish in order, because some take
longer than others.  Each priority level must finish entirely before the
next priority level is run.  See
[PRIORITIES](https://github.com/iarna/run-queue#priorities) below.  This is
even true if concurrency is set high enough that all of the regular queue
can execute at once, for instance, with `maxConcurrency: 10`:

```
[ 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1 ]
```

## API

### const queue = new RunQueue(options)

Create a new queue. Options may contain:

* maxConcurrency - (Default: `1`) The maximum number of jobs to execute at once.
* Promise - (Default: global.Promise) The promise implementation to use.

### queue.add (prio, fn, args)

Add a new job to the end of the queue at priority `prio` that will run `fn`
with `args`. If `fn` is async then it should return a Promise.

### queue.run ()

Start running the job queue.  Returns a Promise that resolves when either
all the jobs are complete or a job ends in error (throws or returns a
rejected promise). If a job ended in error then this Promise will be rejected
with that error and no further queue running will be done.

## PRIORITIES

Priorities are any integer value >= 0.

Lowest is executed first.

Priorities essentially represent distinct job queues.  All jobs in a queue
must complete before the next highest priority job queue is executed.

This means that if you have two queues, `0` and `1` then ALL jobs in `0`
must complete before ANY execute in `1`.  If you add new `0` level jobs
while `1` level jobs are running then it will switch back processing the `0`
queue and won't execute any more `1` jobs till all of the new `0` jobs
complete.

 - sirv@1.0.17

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# sirv ![CI](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

> The optimized and lightweight middleware for serving requests to static assets

You may use `sirv` as a *very* fast and lightweight alternative to [`serve-static`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/serve-static).

The massive performance advantage over `serve-static` is explained by **not** relying on the file system for existence checks on every request. These are expensive interactions and must be avoided whenever possible! Instead, when not in "dev" mode, `sirv` performs all its file-system operations upfront and then relies on its cache for future operations.

This middleware will work out of the box for [Polka](https://github.com/lukeed/polka), Express, and other Express-like frameworks. It will also work with the native `http`, `https` and `http2` modules. It requires _very_ little effort to modify/wrap it for servers that don't accept the `(req, res, next)` signature.

:bulb: For a feature-complete CLI application, check out the sibling [`sirv-cli`](https://github.com/lukeed/sirv/tree/master/packages/sirv-cli) package as an alternative to [`zeit/serve`](https://github.com/zeit/serve)~!

## Install

```
$ npm install --save sirv
```


## Usage

```js
const sirv = require('sirv');
const polka = require('polka');
const compress = require('compression')();

// Init `sirv` handler
const assets = sirv('public', {
  maxAge: 31536000, // 1Y
  immutable: true
});

polka()
  .use(compress, assets)
  .use('/api', require('./api'))
  .listen(3000, err => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('> Ready on localhost:3000~!');
  });
```


## API

### sirv(dir, opts={})

Returns: `Function`

The returned function is a middleware in the standard Express-like signature: `(req, res, next)`, where `req` is the [`http.IncomingMessage`](https://nodejs.org/api/http.html#http_class_http_incomingmessage), `res` is the [`http.ServerResponse`](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v9.x/docs/api/http.html#http_class_http_serverresponse), and `next` (in this case) is the function to call if no file was found for the given path.

When defined, a `next()` callback is always called _instead of_ the [`opts.onNoMatch`](#optsonnomatch) callback. However, unlike `onNoMatch`, your `next()` is given no arguments.

#### dir
Type: `String`<br>
Default: `.`

The directory from which to read and serve assets. It is resolved to an absolute path &mdash; you must provide an absolute path yourself if `process.cwd()` is not the correct assumption.

#### opts.dev
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Enable "dev" mode, which disables/skips caching. Instead, `sirv` will traverse the file system ***on every request***.

Additionally, `dev` mode will ignore `maxAge` and `immutable` as these options generate a production-oriented `Cache-Control` header value.

> **Important:** Do not use `dev` mode in production!

#### opts.etag
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Generate and attach an `ETag` header to responses.

> **Note:** If an incoming request's [`If-None-Match` header](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/If-None-Match) matches the `ETag` value, a `304` response is given.

#### opts.dotfiles
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Allow requests to dotfiles (files or directories beginning with a `.`).

> **Note:** Requests to [`/.well-known/*`](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8615) are always allowed.

#### opts.extensions
Type: `Array<String>`<br>
Default: `['html', 'htm']`

The file extension fallbacks to check for if a pathame is not initially found. For example, if a `/login` request cannot find a `login` filename, it will then look for `login.html` and `login.htm` before giving up~!

> **Important:** Actually, `sirv` will **also** look for `login/index.html` and `login/index.htm` before giving up.

#### opts.gzip
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.gz` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include "gzip" in order for `sirv` to search for the gzip'd alternative.

> **Note:** The `.gz` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.gz', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.gz', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.gz',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: gzip] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.gz',
  '/index.htm.gz',
  '/index.html',
  '/index.htm',
]);
```


#### opts.brotli
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Determine if `sirv` look for **precompiled** `*.br` files.<br>
Must be enabled _and_ the incoming request's [`Accept Encoding`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Encoding) must include either "br" or "brotli" in order for `sirv` to search for the brotli-compressed alternative.

> **Note:** The `.br` assumption also applies to the `opts.extensions` list.

When both `opts.broli` and `opts.gzip` are enabled &mdash; and all conditions are equal &mdash; then the brotli variant always takes priority.

```js
// NOTE: PSEUDO CODE
// Showing lookup logic

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br] "/foobar.jpg"
lookup([
  '/foobar.jpg.br', '/foobar.jpg',
  '/foobar.jpg.html.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.html.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm.br', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm.br',
  '/foobar.jpg.html', '/foobar.jpg/index.html',
  '/foobar.jpg.htm', '/foobar.jpg/index.htm',
]);

// Request: [Accept-Encoding: br,gz] "/"
lookup([
  '/index.html.br'
  '/index.htm.br'
  '/index.html.gz'
  '/index.htm.gz'
  '/index.html'
  '/index.htm'
]);
```

#### opts.maxAge
Type: `Number`<br>
Default: `undefined`

Enables the `Cache-Control` header on responses and sets the `max-age` value (in seconds).<br>
For example, `maxAge: 31536000` is equivalent to one year.

#### opts.immutable
Type: `Boolean`<br>
Default: `false`

Appends the [`immutable` directive](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Cache-Control#Revalidation_and_reloading) on your `Cache-Control` header, used for uniquely-named assets that will not change!

> **Important:** Will only work if `opts.maxAge` has a value defined!

#### opts.single
Type: `Boolean` or `String`<br>
Default: `false`

Treat the directory as a single-page application.

When `true`, the directory's index page (default `index.html`) will be sent if the request asset does not exist.<br>
You may pass a `string` value to use a file _instead of_ `index.html` as your fallback.

For example, if "/about" is requested but no variants of that file exist, then the response for "/" is sent instead:

```js
// Note: This is psuedo code to illustrate what's happening

// Request: "/about"
let file = find(['/about', '/about.html', '/about.htm', '/about/index.html', '/about.htm']);
if (file) {
  send(file);
} else if (opts.single === true) {
  file = find(['/', '/index.html', '/index.htm']);
  send(file);
} else if (typeof opts.single === 'string') {
  file = find([opts.single]);
  send(file);
} else {
  // next() or 404
}
```

#### opts.ignores
Type: `false` or `Array<String | RegExp>`

Specify paths/patterns that should ignore the fallback behavior that `opts.single` provides.

By default, any asset-like path (URLs that end with an extension) will be ignored. This means that, for example, if `/foobar.jpg` is not found, a `404` response is sent instead of the `index.html` fallback.

Additionally, any `/.well-known/*` pathname ignores the fallback ‚Äì as do all other dotfile requests when `opts.dotfiles` is enabled.

Any string value(s) will be passed through `new RegExp(value, 'i')` directly.

Finally, you may set `ignores: false` to disable ***all*** ignores, including the defaults. Put differently, this will fallback ***all*** unknown pathnames to your `index.html` (or custom `opts.single` value).

> **Important:** Only has an effect if `opts.single` is enabled.

#### opts.onNoMatch
Type: `Function`

A custom function to run if a file cannot be found for a given request. <br>By default, `sirv` will send a basic `(404) Not found` response.

The function receives the current `req <IncomingMessage>, res <ServerResponse>` pair for as its two arguments.

> **Note:** This won't run if a `next` callback has been provided to the middleware; see [`sirv`](#sirvdir-opts) description.

#### opts.setHeaders
Type: `Function`

A custom function to append or change any headers on the outgoing response. There is no default.

Its signature is `(res, pathname, stats)`, where `res` is the `ServerResponse`, `pathname` is incoming request path (stripped of queries), and `stats` is the file's result from [`fs.statSync`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_fs_statsync_path).

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - stable@0.1.8

This package contains the following license and notice below:

## Stable

A stable array sort, because `Array#sort()` is not guaranteed stable.

MIT licensed.

[![Node.js CI](https://secure.travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://travis-ci.org/Two-Screen/stable)

[![Browser CI](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable.png)](http://ci.testling.com/Two-Screen/stable)

#### From npm

Install with:

```sh
npm install stable
```

Then use it in Node.js or some other CommonJS environment as:

```js
const stable = require('stable')
```

#### From the browser

Include [`stable.js`] or the minified version [`stable.min.js`]
in your page, then call `stable()`.

 [`stable.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.js
 [`stable.min.js`]: https://raw.github.com/Two-Screen/stable/master/stable.min.js

#### Usage

The default sort is, as with `Array#sort`, lexicographical:

```js
stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'])  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']
stable([10, 1, 5])             // => [1, 10, 5]
```

Unlike `Array#sort`, the default sort is **NOT** in-place. To do an in-place
sort, use `stable.inplace`, which otherwise works the same:

```js
const arr = [10, 1, 5]
stable(arr) === arr          // => false
stable.inplace(arr) === arr  // => true
```

A comparator function can be specified:

```js
// Regular sort() compatible comparator, that returns a number.
// This demonstrates the default behavior.
const lexCmp = (a, b) => String(a).localeCompare(b)
stable(['foo', 'bar', 'baz'], lexCmp)  // => ['bar', 'baz', 'foo']

// Boolean comparator. Sorts `b` before `a` if true.
// This demonstrates a simple way to sort numerically.
const greaterThan = (a, b) => a > b
stable([10, 1, 5], greaterThan)  // => [1, 5, 10]
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - ts-pnp@1.2.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# <img src="http://www.typescriptlang.org/assets/images/icons/apple-touch-icon-180x180.png" height="40" align="right" /> [Plug'n'Play](https://github.com/yarnpkg/rfcs/pull/101) resolver for TypeScript

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)
[![node version](https://img.shields.io/node/v/ts-pnp.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ts-pnp)

*This plugin is also available for Webpack ([pnp-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin)), Jest ([jest-pnp-resolver](https://github.com/arcanis/jest-pnp-resolver)), and Rollup ([rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve](https://github.com/arcanis/rollup-plugin-pnp-resolve))*

## Installation

```
yarn add -D ts-pnp
```

## Usage

*Note that `ts-pnp` is a low-level package - you shouldn't have to use it unless you're writing a TS compiler host. If you just want to write TypeScript and have it Just Work‚Ñ¢, take a look at [`pnp-webpack-plugin`](https://github.com/arcanis/pnp-webpack-plugin#ts-loader-integration) instead.*

This package exports a function that can be used to implement the [`resolveModuleName` hook from `CompilerHost`](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Using-the-Compiler-API#customizing-module-resolution). It mimics the interface from the one you'd typically use and, as all other PnP plugins, works just fine whether your application is actually running under PnP or not.

```js
import {resolveModuleName} from 'ts-pnp';
import * as ts from 'typescript';

function createCompilerHost(
  compilerOptions: ts.CompilerOptions,
): ts.CompilerHost {
  const compilerHost = {
    resolveModuleNames,
    resolveTypeReferenceDirectives,
  };

  return compilerHost;

  function resolveModuleNames(moduleNames: string[], containingFile: string) {
    return moduleNames.map(moduleName => {
      return resolveModuleName(moduleName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveModuleName).resolvedModule;
    });
  }

  function resolveTypeReferenceDirectives(typeDirectiveNames: string[], containingFile: string) {
    return typeDirectiveNames.map(typeDirectiveName => {
      return resolveModuleName(typeDirectiveName, containingFile, compilerOptions, compilerHost, ts.resolveTypeReferenceDirective).resolvedTypeReferenceDirective;
    });
  }
}
```

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - uniqs@2.0.0

This package contains the following license and notice below:

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fgnass/uniqs)

### Tiny utility to create unions and de-duplicated lists.

Example:

```js
var uniqs = require('uniqs');

var foo = { foo: 23 };
var list = [3, 2, 2, 1, foo, foo];

uniqs(list);
// => [3, 2, 1, { foo: 23 }]
```

You can pass multiple lists to create a union:

```js
uniqs([2, 1, 1], [2, 3, 3, 4], [4, 3, 2]);
// => [2, 1, 3, 4]
```

Passing individual items works too:
```js
uniqs(3, 2, 2, [1, 1, 2]);
// => [3, 2, 1]
```

### Summary

* Uniqueness is defined based on strict object equality.
* The lists do not need to be sorted.
* The resulting array contains the items in the order of their first appearance.

### About

This package has been written to accompany utilities like
[flatten](https://npmjs.org/package/flatten) as alternative to full-blown
libraries like underscore or lodash.

The implementation is optimized for simplicity rather than performance and
looks like this:

```js
module.exports = function uniqs() {
  var list = Array.prototype.concat.apply([], arguments);
  return list.filter(function(item, i) {
    return i == list.indexOf(item);
  });
};
```

GNU AFFERO GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 3, 19 November 2007

 Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                            Preamble

  The GNU Affero General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
software and other kinds of works, specifically designed to ensure
cooperation with the community in the case of network server software.

  The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
our General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
software for all its users.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
them if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you
want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
free programs, and that you know you can do these things.

  Developers that use our General Public Licenses protect your rights
with two steps: (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer
you this License which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

  A secondary benefit of defending all users' freedom is that
improvements made in alternate versions of the program, if they
receive widespread use, become available for other developers to
incorporate.  Many developers of free software are heartened and
encouraged by the resulting cooperation.  However, in the case of
software used on network servers, this result may fail to come about.
The GNU General Public License permits making a modified version and
letting the public access it on a server without ever releasing its
source code to the public.

  The GNU Affero General Public License is designed specifically to
ensure that, in such cases, the modified source code becomes available
to the community.  It requires the operator of a network server to
provide the source code of the modified version running there to the
users of that server.  Therefore, public use of a modified version, on
a publicly accessible server, gives the public access to the source
code of the modified version.

  An older license, called the Affero General Public License and
published by Affero, was designed to accomplish similar goals.  This is
a different license, not a version of the Affero GPL, but Affero has
released a new version of the Affero GPL which permits relicensing under
this license.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

                       TERMS AND CONDITIONS

  0. Definitions.

  "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License.

  "Copyright" also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
works, such as semiconductor masks.

  "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
License.  Each licensee is addressed as "you".  "Licensees" and
"recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

  To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
exact copy.  The resulting work is called a "modified version" of the
earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

  A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
on the Program.

  To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
public, and in some countries other activities as well.

  To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

  An interactive user interface displays "Appropriate Legal Notices"
to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
tells the user that there is no warranty for the work (except to the
extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.

  1. Source Code.

  The "source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work
for making modifications to it.  "Object code" means any non-source
form of a work.

  A "Standard Interface" means an interface that either is an official
standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the case of
interfaces specified for a particular programming language, one that
is widely used among developers working in that language.

  The "System Libraries" of an executable work include anything, other
than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface for which an
implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
"Major Component", in this context, means a major essential component
(kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
(if any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.

  The "Corresponding Source" for a work in object code form means all
the source code needed to generate, install, and (for an executable
work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
includes interface definition files associated with source files for
the work, and the source code for shared libraries and dynamically
linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
subprograms and other parts of the work.

  The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
Source.

  The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form is that
same work.

  2. Basic Permissions.

  All rights granted under this License are granted for the term of
copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
covered work is covered by this License only if the output, given its
content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.

  You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
convey, without conditions so long as your license otherwise remains
in force.  You may convey covered works to others for the sole purpose
of having them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide you
with facilities for running those works, provided that you comply with
the terms of this License in conveying all material for which you do
not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
for you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.

  Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
makes it unnecessary.

  3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.

  No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
measures.

  When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
technological measures.

  4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

  You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.

  You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

  5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

  You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.

    b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under this License and any conditions added under section
    7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
    "keep intact all notices".

    c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.

    d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

  A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

  6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

  You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
in one of these ways:

    a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.

    b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
    Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.

    c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.

    d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.

    e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
    you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
    Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
    charge under subsection 6d.

  A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

  A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal, family,
or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for incorporation
into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
product received by a particular user, "normally used" refers to a
typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
the only significant mode of use of the product.

  "Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
code is in no case prevented or interfered with solely because
modification has been made.

  If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

  The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or updates
for a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or for
the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
protocols for communication across the network.

  Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

  7. Additional Terms.

  "Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
this License without regard to the additional permissions.

  When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for material you
add to a covered work, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders of
that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:

    a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or

    b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or

    c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
    requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or

    d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors or
    authors of the material; or

    e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or

    f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
    it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, for
    any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
    those licensors and authors.

  All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by this License along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

  If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

  Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
the above requirements apply either way.

  8. Termination.

  You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

  However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your
license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright
holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
prior to 60 days after the cessation.

  Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

  Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

  9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

  You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.

  10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.

  Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

  An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

  You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

  11. Patents.

  A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

  A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims
owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
this License.

  Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

  In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement).  To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

  If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
license to downstream recipients.  "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

  If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
work and works based on it.

  A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within
the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
work if you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
for and in connection with specific products or compilations that
contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

  Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

  12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

  If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
not convey it at all.  For example, if you agree to terms that obligate you
to collect a royalty for further conveying from those to whom you convey
the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.

  13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your version
supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the Corresponding
Source of your version by providing access to the Corresponding Source
from a network server at no charge, through some standard or customary
means of facilitating copying of software.  This Corresponding Source
shall include the Corresponding Source for any work covered by version 3
of the GNU General Public License that is incorporated pursuant to the
following paragraph.

  Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the covered work,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

  14. Revised Versions of this License.

  The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

  Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
by the Free Software Foundation.

  If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
versions of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

  Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

  15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. Limitation of Liability.

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
SUCH DAMAGES.

  17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

  If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

            How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

  If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

  To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
state the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
    along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

  If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source.  For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code.  There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for the
specific requirements.

  You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.
For more information on this, and how to apply and follow the GNU AGPL, see
<https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - vue-template-compiler@2.6.14

This package contains the following license and notice below:

# vue-template-compiler

> This package is auto-generated. For pull requests please see [src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/entry-compiler.js).

This package can be used to pre-compile Vue 2.0 templates into render functions to avoid runtime-compilation overhead and CSP restrictions. In most cases you should be using it with [`vue-loader`](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-loader), you will only need it separately if you are writing build tools with very specific needs.

## Installation

``` bash
npm install vue-template-compiler
```

``` js
const compiler = require('vue-template-compiler')
```

## API

### compiler.compile(template, [options])

Compiles a template string and returns compiled JavaScript code. The returned result is an object of the following format:

``` js
{
  ast: ?ASTElement, // parsed template elements to AST
  render: string, // main render function code
  staticRenderFns: Array<string>, // render code for static sub trees, if any
  errors: Array<string> // template syntax errors, if any
}
```

Note the returned function code uses `with` and thus cannot be used in strict mode code.

#### Options

- `outputSourceRange` *new in 2.6*
  - Type: `boolean`
  - Default: `false`

  Set this to true will cause the `errors` returned in the compiled result become objects in the form of `{ msg, start, end }`. The `start` and `end` properties are numbers that mark the code range of the error source in the template. This can be passed on to the `compiler.generateCodeFrame` API to generate a code frame for the error.

- `whitespace`
  - Type: `string`
  - Valid values: `'preserve' | 'condense'`
  - Default: `'preserve'`

  The default value `'preserve'` handles whitespaces as follows:

  - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is condensed into a single space.
  - All other whitespaces are preserved as-is.

  If set to `'condense'`:

  - A whitespace-only text node between element tags is removed if it contains new lines. Otherwise, it is condensed into a single space.
  - Consecutive whitespaces inside a non-whitespace-only text node are condensed into a single space.

  Using condense mode will result in smaller compiled code size and slightly improved performance. However, it will produce minor visual layout differences compared to plain HTML in certain cases.

  **This option does not affect the `<pre>` tag.**

  Example:

  ``` html
  <!-- source -->
  <div>
    <span>
      foo
    </span>   <span>bar</span>
  </div>

  <!-- whitespace: 'preserve' -->
  <div> <span>
    foo
    </span> <span>bar</span> </div>

  <!-- whitespace: 'condense' -->
  <div><span> foo </span> <span>bar</span></div>
  ```

- `modules`

  It's possible to hook into the compilation process to support custom template features. **However, beware that by injecting custom compile-time modules, your templates will not work with other build tools built on standard built-in modules, e.g `vue-loader` and `vueify`.**

  An array of compiler modules. For details on compiler modules, refer to the `ModuleOptions` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js#L47-L59) and the [built-in modules](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/modules).

- `directives`

  An object where the key is the directive name and the value is a function that transforms an template AST node. For example:

  ``` js
  compiler.compile('<div v-test></div>', {
    directives: {
      test (node, directiveMeta) {
        // transform node based on directiveMeta
      }
    }
  })
  ```

  By default, a compile-time directive will extract the directive and the directive will not be present at runtime. If you want the directive to also be handled by a runtime definition, return `true` in the transform function.

  Refer to the implementation of some [built-in compile-time directives](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/tree/dev/src/platforms/web/compiler/directives).

- `preserveWhitespace` **Deprecated since 2.6**
  - Type: `boolean`
  - Default: `true`

  By default, the compiled render function preserves all whitespace characters between HTML tags. If set to `false`, whitespace between tags will be ignored. This can result in slightly better performance but may affect layout for inline elements.

---

### compiler.compileToFunctions(template)

Similar to `compiler.compile`, but directly returns instantiated functions:

``` js
{
  render: Function,
  staticRenderFns: Array<Function>
}
```

This is only useful at runtime with pre-configured builds, so it doesn't accept any compile-time options. In addition, this method uses `new Function()` so it is not CSP-compliant.

---

### compiler.ssrCompile(template, [options])

> 2.4.0+

Same as `compiler.compile` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.

This is used by default in `vue-loader@>=12` and can be disabled using the [`optimizeSSR`](https://vue-loader.vuejs.org/en/options.html#optimizessr) option.

---

### compiler.ssrCompileToFunctions(template)

> 2.4.0+

Same as `compiler.compileToFunction` but generates SSR-specific render function code by optimizing parts of the template into string concatenation in order to improve SSR performance.

---

### compiler.parseComponent(file, [options])

Parse a SFC (single-file component, or `*.vue` file) into a descriptor (refer to the `SFCDescriptor` type in [flow declarations](https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/flow/compiler.js)). This is used in SFC build tools like `vue-loader` and `vueify`.

---

### compiler.generateCodeFrame(template, start, end)

Generate a code frame that highlights the part in `template` defined by `start` and `end`. Useful for error reporting in higher-level tooling.

#### Options

#### `pad`

`pad` is useful when you are piping the extracted content into other pre-processors, as you will get correct line numbers or character indices if there are any syntax errors.

- with `{ pad: "line" }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one newline for each line in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the line numbers align with the original file.
- with `{ pad: "space" }`, the extracted content for each block will be prefixed with one space for each character in the leading content from the original file to ensure that the character count remains the same as the original file.

The following NPM package may be included in this product:

 - vue-template-es2015-compiler@1.9.1

This package contains the following license and notice below:

This is an internal package used by `vue-loader` and `vueify`. It processes the raw render functions generated by `vue-template-compiler` to:

1. add support to ES2015 features in template expressions via Buble. (see [supported features here](https://buble.surge.sh/guide/#supported-features)).

**Note:** since version 1.8.0, object rest spread usage inside templates are transpiled to `Object.assign` calls by default. This means if you need to support IE, you will need to polyfill `Object.assign`. (Latest version of Vue CLI will do this for you).

2. remove the `with` block inside render functions to make it strict-mode compliant. This is performed only at build time so that the base template compiler can be extremely small and lightweight.

The buble implementation is built from a fork at https://github.com/yyx990803/buble
