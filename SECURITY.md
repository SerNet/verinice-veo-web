# Security Policy

## Searching for vulnerabilities

We explicitly allow ethical hackers to test our application, but only under these terms:

- Do not use off-the-shelf scanners, try to avoid useless traffic.
- Set a sensible rate limiting (e.g. 600/min)
- Do not access customer data, use your own accounts where possible.
- No phishing, no DDoS, no post-exploitation...

### Scope

To be clear, you're only allowed to test veo-web.verinice.com, api.verinice.com, auth.verinice.com, account.verinice.com and nothing else.
