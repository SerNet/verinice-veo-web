### Features & Benefits

#### Up and running in 5 minutes / Cloud Native

As a cloud-based software-as-a-service solution, VEO is ready for immediate use. All data is securely stored in Germany with a German hosting provider in an ISO 27001-certified data centre in compliance with DSGVO.

VEO meets the CNCF (CNCF.io) requirements for cloud native software: open source, vendor-neutral, resilient, manageable and observable.
VEO relies on cloud technologies such as containers, Kubernetes and microservices and is optimised for operation in public, private and hybrid clouds.

#### A Real Perspective / Integrated Management System

= Domains

Use all objects such as processes, assets, people, etc. in all perspectives. Eliminate the time-consuming redundant and error-prone multiple entry of objects for different management systems.

#### Purely a matter of opinion

Scopes / object of view

#### Construction kit

All Lego? Composites

#### Version history

No change is lost in VEO - all entries are stored in the object history in a traceable and audit-proof manner. Any previous editing status of an object can be restored with a mouse click.

#### Form editor

With the form editor, you can adapt all screen masks to your individual circumstances and the requirements of your organisation.  Add any input fields, change the order and grouping of fields or develop completely new forms.

#### Self customising

Use the subject area editor to edit the basic subject structure: adapt the object types offered from data protection, basic IT protection or other subject areas to your organisation-specific features. Design completely new subject areas and use your existing objects in them as well. This is how you create your integrated management system (IMS), which includes e.g. data protection, IT-Grundschutz, quality management and industry-specific standards.

Also define the possible relationships between different objects completely freely - this ensures that you can map all relationships in verinice as they actually exist in your organisation.

#### A whole always consists of parts

Things in your organisation are structured hierarchically: Processes have
sub-processes. A location consists of buildings and these contain rooms. A
server consists of several hardware components. All of this can be mapped in VEO
depicted. Each object in Veo can in turn contain other objects as components.
as components. There are no limits to this: an object can be a component of any
of any number of other objects. For example, an employee can be part of his or her department, a member of
department, be a member of various teams and also be assigned to projects.
assigned to projects. An object can always and everywhere be used as a substitute for its
for its components - either a single person can be deposited as the responsible
person can be deposited as responsible for an asset, or a whole group of people.

VEO thus offers maximum flexibility in the representation of the real
realities: a single activity can be part of any number of processes.
processes. A server consists of several hardware components. A building can
be part of several defined protection zones - put together your organisation as
as it is actually structured.

#### Tenary Relationships

In addition to the part-whole relationship described above, which is supported by every object in VEO, meaningful relationships can also be used.

these objects can be created. A process has responsible parties, a risk

either a single object or a group can be used in each case.

#### Scopes: The scope of observation

Company structures are complex: in addition to the line organisation of department, division and team
department and team, there are numerous other criteria according to which objects may be
according to which one would like to group objects. Projects consist of assigned assets,
personnel and processes. Audits require the definition of the object to be audited.
Basic protection demands the delineation of the information network.

All these and other groupings can be mapped in VEO. At the same time
structures can be nested as deeply as desired. An object can be
be assigned to any number of such scopes - an asset or an employee, for example, can be
