title: Object model

Verinice.veo supports users in setting up and operating management systems for information security and data protection. Generic subject objects are defined in the object model of veo for this purpose, which can be used simultaneously for the different management systems. There is one model with which all procedures and standards can be mapped.

This has the advantage that users can, for example, start with the development of an ISMS according to ISO 27000. The same data can also be used later for a directory of processing activities. In data protection, the process object can be a procedure for a directory of processing activities. At the same time, the same process can also be part of a risk analysis according to ISO 27005.

The model also fulfils requirements for the operation of a SaaS application that is used by many different customers. The data from different customers in the model are securely separated from each other by organisational objects.
