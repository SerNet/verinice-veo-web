# Security Policy

## Searching for Vulnerabilities

We explicitly allow ethical hackers to test our application, but only under the following terms:

- Do not use off-the-shelf scanners; please avoid useless traffic
- Please try to avoid accessing customer data; use your accounts where possible
- Clean up after testing
- **Ethical hacking**: no phishing, no DDoS, no post exploitation...

## Scope

To be clear, you're only allowed to test `*.prod.verinice.com` and nothing else.
And of course you can use the source code (link).

TODO: list all hosts, get source code link

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please e-mail to security@verinice.com if you believe you have found a security issue in verinice.

Please try to cover the following info in your bug report:

- Proof of Concept: exact steps to reproduce the bug
- How did you discover the vulnerability?
- Your estimation of impact
- Suggestions for a fix

When we receive a bug report, we will look at it internally before answering, so expect some delay until you get an answer.
Once we confirmed the bug and discussed about the vulnerability, we will contact you.

## Responsible Disclosure

The bug stays yours, but please give us enough time to fix it before disclosing it.
We need up to 120 days to fix the vulnerability you reported. Once we patched the vulnerability and told you we're done from our end, you can disclose the bug.
