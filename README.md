## License headers
Each file has to contain a license header. This project contains configuration for the VSCode Plugin [psioniq File Header](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=psioniq.psi-header). If you use this plugin, the license header will get automatically generated for new files and files that don't contain a header yet. Please add your name to the license header of every file you make meaningful changes in.

## License generation
To regenerate the `LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.txt` file, run `npx generate-license-file --input .\package.json --output LICENSE-3RD-PARTY.txt`
