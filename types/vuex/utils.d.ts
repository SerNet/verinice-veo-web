/**
 * Type level utility to annotate types of module state/getters/actions/mutations (module assets).
 * To use this helper, the user should declare corresponding assets type at first.
 *
 * A getters type should be an object that the keys indicate getter names
 * and its corresponding values indicate return types of the getter.
 *
 * Actions type and mutations type should be an object that the keys indicate
 * action/mutation names as same as the getters type.
 * Its values should be declared as payload types of the actions/mutation.
 *
 * After declare the above types, the user put them on the generic parameters
 * of the utility type. Then the real assets object must follow the passed types
 * and type inference will work.
 *
 * The declared types will be used on mapXXX helpers to safely use module assets
 * by annotating its types.
